There’s the show’s design expert Bobby Berk, the food and wine expert Antoni Porowski, the grooming expert Jonathan Van Ness, and the fashion expert Tan France.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_35>As the culture expert, Brown often helps people talk through some of the most challenging aspects of their lives. However, this Queer Eye cast member wasn’t the Fab Five member who studied psychology in college.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Antoni Porowski studied psychology in college</h2><p id=par-5_36>Porowski may be a self-taught cook, but he has a former education with a specialization in another Queer Eye-related subject. This food and wine expert graduated from Canada’s <a href=#>Concordia University</a> with a bachelor’s degree in Psychology.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_38>He then studied acting at New York City’s Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. Porowski worked as an actor for some time before joining the Fab Five and then branching out to become a restanteur and best-selling author.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_34>He may be the culture expert of Queer Eye, but Brown, reportedly, didn’t study psychology as an undergraduate. According to <a href=#>Narcity</a>, Brown graduated from Florida A&M University with a bachelor’s degree in business administration.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_40>After graduating, he pursued a career in social work, practicing for about a decade before joining the Fab Five of Netflix’s original series. Now, he’s a best-selling author as well as an activist and former Dancing With the Stars competitor.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Antoni Porowski also offers emotional support for local heroes&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-9_44>Each of these experts offer their emotional support on Queer Eye. When the Fab Five members each took a lie detector test with <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, Van Ness asked the food and wine expert if he studied psychology in college, to which he said yes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_59>“Do you think you could do as good of a job as Karamo in dealing with people,” Van Ness asked, to which Porowski also said yes. Porowski does have the chance to inspire local heroes with his food, though. For some who appeared in the series, he offered his knowledge with the hopes that they’ll live a healthier lifestyle.</p><p id=par-11_36>Although some new episodes of this reality show are in the works, fans can watch already released seasons of Queer Eye on the streaming platform.
