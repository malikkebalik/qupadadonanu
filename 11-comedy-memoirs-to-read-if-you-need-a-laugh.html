Everyone has their go-to genre to <a href=# class=T3D>cheer up</a>. When life gets you down, you might peace out to Westeros or Narnia. Or when you find yourself in the doldrums, you might reach for a hefty work of literary fiction to help you wallow. But for me, at least, the best attack on a gloomy mood is a well-written <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>comedy memoir.</a></p><p>I was bitten by the funny memoir bug when I was about 10 or 11. My favorite musical at the time was <i>Gypsy,</i> and some negligent adult allowed me to check <i>Gypsy: Memoirs of America's Most Celebrated Stripper</i> out of the library. I was embarrassed to read it in public, because the cover was just as scandalous as you might think. And I'm sure a <i>lot</i> of the stuff about early burlesque theatre flew right over my head. But I loved the way that Gypsy Rose Lee looked back on her dysfunctional family with humor. I loved peering into someone's strange and sometimes sad past, but more than anything, I loved the way she could spin tragedy into <a href=# class=T3D>comedy.</a></p><p>Some memoirs exist to give you a new perspective on life, or to remind you that people can overcome adversity. These memoirs exist because sometimes you just have to look back at your life and laugh:</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Bossypants</i></a> by Tina Fey</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>If you're a Tina Fey fan, chances are you've already read this book at least twice. Consider this an invitation to read it again (or for the first time, even if you don't know much about Tina Fey). Fey writes about her awkward childhood, her years as a struggling twenty-something trying to break into comedy, and her rise to SNL fame. But she also has time to skewer the beauty industry and the "boy's club" of TV, and just generally inspire her readers to be as bossy and as funny as possible.</p><h3>2. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Born Standing Up: A Comic's Life</i></a> by Steve Martin</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>Steve Martin started his career at <i>age 10.</i> So he has plenty of comedic memories to go around. This book is funny, of course (it's <i>Steve Martin</i>). But it's also candid and, at times, heartfelt. Martin chronicles his life in comedy from his start as a teenaged magician in Disneyland, but he also paints a portrait of the era he grew up in, and of the trials and tribulations of starting out so young.</p><h3>3. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns)</i></a> by Mindy Kaling</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>I, like everyone else on this planet, wish that Mindy Kaling could be my best friend. But she's probably too busy (and she lives on the other side of the country), so I'll have to settle for re-reading her first memoir. It's the perfect blend of bubbly, snarky, honest, and sheer fun. It's like a sleepover with friends, except you also get to hear about Kaling's adolescent awkwardness and her opinions on rom-coms as a sub-genre of science fiction.</p><h3>4. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Yes Please</i></a> by Amy Poehler</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>Writing a book, as Amy Poehler reminds us several times in <i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Yes Please</a>,</i> is very hard. But in this case, the hard work has paid off. Poehler is hysterically funny and inspirational, of course, because that's who she is. But she's also made of stern stuff, and her book is a testament to how strong you have to be to make your living as a funny woman.</p><h3>5. <i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</a> </i>by Issa Rae</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>Issa Rae is the creator of a hit web series, but, according to her memoir, she's also a hugely awkward introvert (and she's not shy about saying so). Her collection of essays is full of insight and honesty, but she has a gift for turning her misadventures into hilariously identifiable stories. It's not quite the same as her acclaimed web series, but it's a far more personal, and equally funny, piece of writing.</p><h3>6. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Let's Pretend This Never Happened: A Mostly True Memoir</i> </a>by Jenny Lawson</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>You might be noticing a slight pattern here: a lot of these comedic memoirs are written by people with painfully, <i>unrelentingly awkward</i> childhoods. Jenny Lawson is no exception, but she does take it to the next level. Her memoir is all about those excruciating moments that define us. And she doesn't pull any punches.</p><h3>7. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Harpo Speaks!</i> </a>by Harpo Marx and Rowland Barber</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>For the old school comedy fan, you can't get much more classic than the Marx Brothers. (If you've never seen a Marx Brothers movie, please do so at this time. I'll wait.) Harpo, famously mute onscreen, finally gets a voice in this absurdly funny, outrageous memoir. He writes about growing up in poverty, clowning his way to the top, and getting up to no good with the cinema and literary greats of the 20th century.</p><h3>8. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Me Talk Pretty One Day</i> </a>by David Sedaris</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>Look, I know David Sedaris is old news by now. But damn is he funny. There's a reason his comedic memoirs are so widely read. He doesn't just crack jokes or try to get by on shock value: he digs down deep into the recesses of his childhood and his offbeat family history, and he uncovers gem after gem. And <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Me Talk Pretty One Day</i></a> is quite possibly the funniest memoir ever he's written.</p><h3>9. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Girl Walks into a Bar</i></a> by Rachel Dratch</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>If you've ever said, "Who's that one woman from SNL? The <i>Debbie Downer</i> lady? Where'd she go?" this book has all the answers. Rachel Dratch is an actress and comedian by trade, so of course she's ready with zany stories about showbiz and being typecast as trolls. But she also has some sharp observations on life, love, and a late-in-life unexpected pregnancy.</p><h3>10. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Fresh Off the Boat</i></a> by Eddie Huang</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>Celebrity chef Eddie Huang is <i>also</i> a hilariously gifted writer and comedian (because life is unfair), and his memoir is a candid look at growing up in theme-park America. It's got humor, family, and, most importantly, <i>food</i>. What else do you want in a memoir?</p><h3>11. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Hyperbole and a Half</i></a> by Allie Brosh</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Click Here To Buy</b></a></p><p>No list of funny memoirs is complete without Allie Brosh. Very few other cartoonists could cover everything from dogs to cake to depression with the heart and humor of <i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hyperbole and a Half</a>.</i> The illustrations are laugh-out-loud funny on their own, but Brosh's writing makes this memoir into the chaotic, hilarious book that it is.</p><p><i>Images: Universal Pictures</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygo9ta2tlYWZ6pLvMnpuyZZ2aurC10axkraddp7KisIyinWaxn6p6r7HEnWSaZZyWwqi0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
