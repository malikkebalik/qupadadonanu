Mia quickly became an icon for bookish girls everywhere, as readers were made privy to her innermost thoughts, sarcastic commentary, hilarious royalty lessons from her grandmother Clarisse, and her first experiences with love, friendship drama, and family upheaval.</p><p>Of course, the books were eventually adapted into two equally beloved films starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews. (A <a href=# class=T3D>third Princess Diaries film </a>is reportedly in the works.) But if you just can't wait for more royals stories that will fulfill all of your teen dreams, I've got 13 books below that should hold you over until Mia is back on the big screen. These books, both adult and YA, offer the same vibes you loved from Princess Diaries: characters who are unexpectedly (and often hilariously) thrust into the royal spotlight, and how that harsh glare affects them, their families and friends, and how they pursue romance:</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">'Royal Wedding' by Meg Cabot</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>Meg Cabot continues Mia's story in this 2016 sequel, set five years after her college graduation.

Now, Mia not has to be ready to wed, but maybe to rule as well.
