Let’s take a deep dive into Robyn’s Pinterest account, specifically the board titled “For Kody.” The board holds a plethora of cheesy quotes Robyn saved for Kody, but here are the five most cringe-inducing pins."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It also seems insensitive, considering Robyn is the only wife legally married to Kody.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/David-Ariella-Robyn-Kody-Solomon-Breanna-and-Aurora-Brown-‘Sister-Wives-TLC.jpeg><p id=par-4_60>It’s also tasteless for her to refer to her home as a “castle,” considering that it’s true, at least in comparison to her sister wives. Robyn owns a <a href=#>$900,000 home</a> with her “king” Kody, and he spends all of his time with her there. Meanwhile, Janelle has a fifth-wheel trailer, no assets, and helped pay for the said castle.</p><h2>4. ‘If a Capricorn gives you their time, you obviously mean something to them as they don’t waste their time on people they see as useless.’</h2><p id=par-5_64><a href=#>Kody’s astrological sign</a> is a Capricorn. Robyn saved a quote about how Capricorns don’t spend their time on “useless” people. This quote is cringe-inducing for so many reasons. There’s no telling why Robyn felt the need to save this quote for Kody, especially considering that one of the biggest issues in Kody’s other marriage was the equal division of Kody’s time between wives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kody-Brown-and-Robyn-Brown-Sister-Wives-_-TLC.jpeg><p id=par-6_43>As Sister Wives fans know, <a href=#>Robyn received special treatment</a> since the beginning, and now she has Kody to herself almost exclusively. This quote essentially says that Kody wouldn’t waste his time on “useless” people. Does Robyn see the other wives as “useless”?</p><h2>3. ‘Sometimes, the love of your life comes after the mistake of your life.’</h2><p id=par-7_45>This one is pretty straightforward. In June 1999, 21-year-old Robyn married her first husband,&nbsp;<a href=#>David Jessop</a>. During their 8-year-long marriage, they had three children,&nbsp;<a href=#>Dayton, Aurora, and Breanna</a>. After Robyn divorced David, she spent a few years alone as a single mom before she met Kody.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sister-wives-kody-robyn-brown.jpg><p id=par-8_48>This quote seems a bit strange to call the first marriage, the one that gave her three children, one of the biggest mistakes of her life. As Sister Wives fans know, after Kody adopted the three children, she removed all signs of David from her children’s life.</p><h2>2. ‘A real alpha will do whatever it takes to achieve his goals, even if it means standing alone.’</h2><p id=par-9_50>This quote is cringe-worthy on so many levels. Since Robyn saved this pin for Kody, it clearly shows that she’s the one who has been calling him an alpha. In a recent Cameo, Kody <a href=#>referred to himself as an alpha male</a> for the first time, and fans were shocked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kody-robyn-and-meri-brown.jpg><p id=par-10_27>Would Robyn encourage Kody to remove all of the other distractions (i.e., the other wives) to focus on his goal (i.e., her and her five kids)?</p><p id=par-11_33>Is this her way of telling Kody that <a href=#>alpha males demand respect</a> and give up on the mothers of their children simply because they no longer align with his goals? Yikes, Robyn.</p><h2 id=h-1-i-like-men-with-massive-throbbing-vocabularies>1. ‘I like men with massive, throbbing vocabularies.’</h2><p id=par-12_37>This saved quote from Robyn to Kody takes the cake for the cringiest quote — possibly of all time. Kody does have an extensive vocabulary, but I’m not sure Robyn is talking about words here. Cringe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kody-Brown-and-Robyn-Brown-Sister-Wives-TLC.jpeg><p id=par-13_13>New episodes of&nbsp;Sister Wives&nbsp;Season 17 air Sundays at 10 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqr%2FTnqlmr5mrsrR5lGamn2WipK%2B6uoybqaivnqh6rrvSrWScqpmjtKZ51qipraCpYr2qutOeqZ6rpGK%2BtrvTnqpmq5iaerSt1Z6bZp6fp3qsu8OyZaGsnaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
