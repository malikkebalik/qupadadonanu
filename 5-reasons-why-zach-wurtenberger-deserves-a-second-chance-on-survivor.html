Recommended Videos If you have been keeping up with Big Brother 25, you may know Zach Wurtenberger as the older brother of Cory Wurtenberger, one of this season’s beloved houseguests. While Cory has been thriving on the hit competition series (avoiding the block for three weeks in a row), Zach had far less reality TV success when he was on Survivor just last year."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was voted out first.”</p><p>America: “You’re already doing better than him.”</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>As Cory mentioned to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America Lopez</a> last night (August 30) on Big Brother, Zach was a competitor on Survivor 42, however, he was the first castaway eliminated – yikes!</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Beginning the game on&nbsp;the Ika tribe, Zach formed a close bond with some of his tribemates right away, most notably third-place finisher Romeo Escobar, due to their similar body type and stature.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>While it seemed to be smooth sailing, the Ika tribe suffered a devastating immunity loss on the third day, caused primarily by Zach’s less-than-ideal performance on the puzzle portion of the challenge. Because of this,&nbsp;Swati Goel proposed the idea of voting for Zach at tribal council for costing the Ika tribe the win, a plan which ultimately prevailed as successful.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Taking one last attempt at securing his safety, Zach forfeited his vote and used his&nbsp;Shot in the Dark&nbsp;die at&nbsp;tribal council. Unfortunately, he was unsuccessful, ultimately making history as the first player voted out unanimously (with the exception of Jeff Varner’s self-elimination in Survivor: Game Changers), leaving the game in a 5-0 vote.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly</a>, Zach dished about his decision to use his Shot in the Dark die that fateful night.</p><p>“I’ve just been watching this show for so long, and even though I did really connect with all my tribemates really well, it wasn’t like a social issue or anything. I was just not getting the confirmation from people that I needed… I got that a little bit from Romeo, but really not from the other people. I feel like Swati, for me, was a really good litmus test, and the fact that Swati couldn’t even look me in the eyes was a pretty good sign of like, ‘Oh wow, this is not going to be going well.'”</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Zach’s journey on Survivor was underwhelming, to say the least, but that does not mean that he is a bad player by any means.

That couldn’t be further from the truth. I am a hustler. I’ve worked hard for my grades, my scores, and my competitive success. I wanted to go to a top-tier school, so I worked hard to get in. I have worked hard for what I have, and I’m proud of it… In speech and debate, I competed against hundreds of students from around the country every weekend. These people were just as smart as me, just as well-spoken, and just as talented, but I beat them because I worked harder and because I wanted it more.”</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>With only three days on the beach, Zach did not get the chance to show his tribemates just how hard of a worker he truly is. With more days in the game, we know that the 23-year-old can be an asset to his team in the future!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>He is smart</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zachary Wurtenberger (@zachwurt)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=119 data-injectable=false>Zach mentioned that he worked hard to get into a top-tier school, and based on his Instagram profile, he certainly did.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>The Florida native attended Washington University in St. Louis and graduated this past December. In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>, Zach shared that he would have graduated on time if Survivor did’nt put a wrench in his plans!</p><p>“Quick story: Freshman year, I learned that if you stepped on this seal, you’d graduate late. Most people avoided it. Meanwhile, I probably stepped on that thing a thousand times over the last four years, trying desperately to will Survivor into my life (and as a result, delay my graduation). Somehow it actually worked, and thanks to my stint in Fiji I’m still a solid 15 credits away from my degree… Even though I’m not leaving WashU this year, so many of the people who’ve made this place so special to me are, so it still feels like the end, even if I still have a little bit left to go. Congratulations to all of my friends who are officially alumni — I love you all and I’m going to miss you so much.”</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, Zach still managed to earn his degree from Washington University in St. Louis, which has been ranked 15th out of 443 national universities in the 2022-2023 edition of Best Colleges. How impressive is that?</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>While falling short on a puzzle may have lead to his demise the first time around, we are confident Zach could put his brains to good use should he be given the opportunity to return to the beach.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>He is a Survivor superfan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zachary Wurtenberger (@zachwurt)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>To top it all off, Zach knows the ins and outs of the hit competition series, which would be a great asset if he were to play Survivor for a second time.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Parade</a> prior to the premiere of Survivor 42, Zach was asked the question “Why are you here on&nbsp;Survivor?” and his answer seriously warmed our hearts.</p><p>“I’ve literally been watching this show my entire&nbsp;life. Like actually my entire life, because I’m 21 years old. I’m the same age as the show. It’s been my dream my entire life. You can find the essays I wrote in third grade or whatever, where I’m actually writing ‘My dream is to be on&nbsp;Survivor,’ and I’m somebody where, if there’s something I want to accomplish, I can’t sleep until I actually get to do it. I’ve never been someone who’s just happy being an observer. I always feel like I need to participate [and] to put my stamp on the game, and that’s what I hope to do here.”</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>If this does not prove that Zach is the ultimate Survivor fan, one look at his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok profile</a> should seal the deal for those who are skeptical.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>With just four videos (all of which relate to the show), he even has a post that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">displays all of the work he did to get cast on Survivor</a>. Let’s just say that his research was extensive, to say the least…</p><h2 data-injectable=false>He has been preparing for a second chance</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zachary Wurtenberger (@zachwurt)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false>Despite being voted out first on Survivor 42, Zach has had quite a bit of time to reflect on his past mistakes since filming wrapped back in 2021.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly</a> — right after his untimely exit — Zach reflected on his “overwhelmingly positive” Survivor experience and how he has been coping since it came to a close.</p><p>“I feel like&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;screws everyone off in some way, and it’s kind of your own special thing, like what do you take away from it that’s wrong with you? And I really do feel lucky overall. I view my&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;experience as overwhelmingly positive… I’ve had the past 10 months to kind of play through what I would’ve done differently and what I could have changed.”</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>Staying very connected with the Survivor community (even going on a trip with Claire Rafson, Jeanine Zheng, and Xander Hastings earlier this summer), it is safe to assume that he is still very invested in the beloved competition series and would be open to playing again.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Us Weekly</a>, he even admitted that returning to the beach would be a no-brainer if he was offered a second chance.</p><p>“It’s impossible to say no to&nbsp;Survivor. It really is. We talk about it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, right, and if you get a once in a lifetime opportunity twice, it’s impossible to say no. I would definitely play again.”</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Now he just needs to sit by the phone and wait for Jeff Probst to give him a call.

SO beyond proud of my brother for making his dream come true, despite it seeming LITERALLY impossible. Seriously. This isn’t just a big deal, this is unprecedented.
