OK, only one of those things is true<i>, </i>but, what's certain is that, with Halloween season upon us, it's time to be scared, preferably by <a href=# class=T3D>a Halloween movie</a>. It doesn't matter whether you've been planning the perfect costume since Nov. 1 of last year or whether you've sworn off dressing up all together — a fright is out to get you this holiday. And as everyone knows, there's nothing like a scare to bring you closer to your significant other. Keeping in mind any romantic inclinations you might have this Halloween, consider spending the night doing — what is it the kids are calling it? — oh, Netflix and chill. (That just means sitting on a couch watching TV, right?) If so, you're going to want to have some options for <a href=# class=T3D>romantic Halloween movies on Netflix</a>, and luckily, I've got you covered.</p><p>Now, if you're like me, you prefer to keep your scares to a minimum, and, if you're even more like me, within the confines of your own home. Boarding yourself up in your home on Halloween leaves little options for frights, but the one thing that can always be counted on to add a little excitement to your Halloween is a <a href=# class=T3D>good old Halloween movie</a>, especially if you're with a significant other. These seven romantic Halloween movies, all available on Netflix, will take the sweet-toothed holiday to a more romantic level — so get ready for an interesting night.</p><h3>1. <i>The Village</i></h3><p>M. Night Shyamalan's 2004 classic, <i>The Village</i>, is probably a bit more romance than it is horror, but the creepy monsters and beautiful cinematography make the movie more than Halloween appropriate.</p><h3>2.<i> The One I Love</i></h3><p>OK, this one is also more on the romantic side than Halloween-esque. From director Charlie McDowell, <i>The One I Love</i> stars Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss as a couple struggling to hold onto their marriage, who end up in a strange, somewhat supernatural house for a weekend. <i>The One I Love</i> is not a Halloween movie in the traditional, spooky-scary sense, but it is a psychological thriller that will stay with you long after the night is over.</p><h3>3. <i>Horns</i></h3><p><i>Horns</i> (2014) will have you wondering: Is it wrong to be turned on by Daniel Radcliffe with horns growing out of his head and a snake around his neck? This dark comedy about a man accused of murdering his girlfriend is probably in the dictionary under the term "romantic Halloween movie." Need another reason to watch? Did I mention Daniel Radcliffe <i>with horns</i>?!</p><h3>4. <i>Corpse Bride</i></h3><p>You didn't think you'd get through this list without at least one Tim Burton movie, did you? <i>Corpse Bride</i> (2009) is a gorgeous animated film from the director, starring the voices of — who else — Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. It's PG rated, so it's 100% kid friendly and adorable. It might not make you scream out loud, but it will make you believe that Halloween might be the most romantic holiday around.</p><h3>5. <i>Sleepy Hollow</i></h3><p>This is the last Tim Burton movie on this list, I promise. Once again, Johnny Depp stars in this creepy Tim Burton horror-romance I specifically remember being too young to watch. This R-rated drama is much more traditionally frightening than <i>Corpse Bride</i>, and also features a period romance between Depp's character and Christina Ricci.</p><h3>6. <i>Underworld</i></h3><p>A forbidden love between a vampire and a werewolf — no, this isn't some weird version of <i>Twilight</i>. <i>Underworld</i> might look like a dark love story, but it's really more of an excuse to watch star Kate Beckinsale kick butt. Win-win!</p><h3>7. <i>Honeymoon</i></h3><p>Newlyweds Bea (Rose Leslie) and Paul (Harry Treadaway) commit the ultimate horror movie sin in <i>Honeymoon</i> (2014): taking a vacation at a remote cabin by a lake<i>. </i>Honeymoon romance meets cabin in the woods horror — sounds like a Halloween romance to me.</p><p>In case none of those fit your fancy, here are a few honorable mentions also <a href=# class=T3D>streaming on Netflix</a>: <i>Heathers</i>, <i>The Addams Family</i>, and <i>Kiss of the Damned</i> (which stars Milo Ventimiglia, for all you #TeamJess fans out there). If movies aren't your thing, there are also a ton of romantic-horror-fantasy shows available to stream on Netflix, including <i>iZombie</i>, <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer,</i> and <i>American Horror Story</i>. Basically, no matter what your taste: when it comes to a Netflix halloween, you're covered.</p><p><i>Images: Dimension Films; <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Giphy</a> (7)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfZduZ3JlZ2K%2FsLnAp6uim12drq24zrCcnqZdory3tcSsZKimXaOytbLLoq9msZ%2BqeqStzWaarpyUobJuwc9mrqKsmGK8r3nOnKtma2E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
