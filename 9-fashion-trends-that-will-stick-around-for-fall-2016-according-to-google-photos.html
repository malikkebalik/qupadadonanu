Every time you type &#34;bodysuits&#34; into your search bar (which I do more than I would like to admit), Google takes notice."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After analyzing search data, Google was able to determine the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>top trends of Fall 2016</a>.</p><p>Every time you type "bodysuits" into your search bar (which I do more than I would like to admit), Google takes notice. Google can then track the volume of these searches and compare them year-over-year, which led them to a discovery that they can predict which <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>fashion trends</a> are growing in popularity and which are dropping in popularity.</p><p>Google looked at data from May 2014 to May 2016 in the United States and the UK to determine which trends you'll be seeing around this fall and which you might want to avoid investing in. Some trends that are slowly decreasing in popularity are drop crotch pants, see-through clothes (but perhaps "sheer" clothes will be sticking around?), acid wash jeans, and babydoll dresses. Google has also declared that the "falling star" of this season, aka the "fads that have reached their peak and have already started to decline rapidly," is suede skirts. How sad.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Timur Emek/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>But onto the positive. Here are the nine <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>top Fall 2016 trends</a>, according to Google.</p><h3>1. Off-The-Shoulder Tops</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>Plus Size Choker Bodysuit, $19.90, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>forever21.com</i></a></p><p>From December 2015 to May 2016, "off-the-shoulder" searches increased by 347 percent in the United States. One of the most popular searches was how to wear off-the-shoulder tops and chokers. This off-the-shoulder choker bodysuit kills three trendy birds with one stone.</p><h3>2. Bodysuits</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>Out From Under Plunging Turtleneck Bodysuit, $39, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>urbanoutfitters.com</i></a></p><p>Bodysuits became my lifeblood this summer and I can't stand the idea of giving them up for fall. Luckily I don't have to. This turtleneck one won't necessarily keep you warm, but boy is it cute.</p><h3>3. Lace-Up Tops</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>Contemporary Lace-Up Top, $17.90, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>forever21.com</i></a></p><p>This trend is still popular in the United States, but dropping in popularity in the UK — which may be a warning sign that it might soon be on the decline in the United States. However, that doesn't mean you should stop wearing them.</p><h3>4. Bralettes</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>Get Down Halter Bra, $38, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>freepeople.com</i></a></p><p>I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that bralettes will never go out of fashion again. Who doesn't love being comfortable?</p><h3>5. Dashiki Dress</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>Deluxe Dashiki, $16.99, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>ragstock.com</i></a></p><p>Dashiki dresses are growing in popularity in both the UK and the United States, making them a popular go-to as fall approaches.</p><h3>6. Bomber Jackets</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>Eliza Slinky MA1 Bomber, $26, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Boohoo.com</i></a></p><p>Searches for bomber jackets went up 612% in the United States in 2016, and were frequently associated with none other than GigI Hadid. Of the top colors, black was number one, followed closely by pink!</p><h3>7. Boho Dress</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>ASOS Mix And Match Printed Tea Dress, $57, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>asos.com</i></a></p><p>While there are no specific parameters as to what defines a "boho dress" exactly, you know it when you see it, even if Google only knows it because the brand has labeled it as such.</p><h3>8. Ripped Jeans</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><i>Relaxed Fit Ripped Jeans, $49.90, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Zara.com</i></a></p><p>Ripped jeans are in it for the long haul, according to Google. Searches for ripped jeans have been increasing at a stable rate over the past couple years, making them a safe bet for your fall wardrobe. Which is good because I'm not sure I own a pair of jeans that aren't ripped.</p><h3>9. Biker Pants</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>Zip Detail Biker Joggers, $32, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>missguidedus.com</i></a></p><p>Biker pants, like ripped jeans, have slowly been growing in popularity over the years, making them a very solid purchase (sounds like something a financial advisor would say). These pink ones are cute and comfy.</p><p><i>Images: </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Forever21.com</i></a><i> (2), </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Urbanoutfitters.com</i></a><i>, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Freepeople.com</i></a><i>, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Ragstock.com</i></a><i>, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Boohoo.com</i></a><i>, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Asos.com</i></a><i>, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Zara.com</i></a><i>, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Missguidedus.com</i></a></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhI9ubm1laWKzor%2FHoqanZaSnsq%2Bw0maroZmkYsSquMtmqq2hk6B6or7OrqWdZZakv26ywKWjZmpgZoNurcKcpqucmaO0bsDOZp6op5ehsm68x6irqKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
