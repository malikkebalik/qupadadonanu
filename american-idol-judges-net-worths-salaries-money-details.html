He’s been incredibly impressed with all of the talented performers he has seen audition for </span><i><span>American Idol</span></i><span> throughout the seasons.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“From my standpoint, I have never enjoyed a period of my career more than right now because I have never cried more in public than I’ve ever done on this show,” Lionel admitted during a February 2022 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a><span> while celebrating the show’s 20th anniversary. “At this stage of your life, you think, ‘OK, I’ve been through everything. I’ve experienced everything. Nothing can rock me.’ And these kids come in one by one and take me out.”</span></p><p><span>Luke, who has several chart-topping hits of his own, also loves mentoring contestants and helping them launch their careers.</span></p><p><span>“My thing is, I remember the joy of when my career really started to take off, I remember that feeling and how special that feeling is and how much fun it is,” the “Country Girl” crooner remarked during a September 2022 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>Parade</span></i></a><span>. “So, anytime I can help someone have that feeling and feel that rise to stardom, I really, really enjoy that role.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see the </b><b><i>American Idol</i></b><b> judges’ net worths.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46apJ6qmZiur3nInaalZZqqsaix0malnqxdrLyzwMesZKyZnJa%2FqrHSZqSoppWueqWx05qgpatf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
