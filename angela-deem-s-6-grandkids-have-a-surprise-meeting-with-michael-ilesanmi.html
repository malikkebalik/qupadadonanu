The Georgia grandma has spent years fighting to bring her Nigerian husband, Michael Ilesanmi, to the U.S. After countless disappointments and growing fears about Michael’s intentions, Angela’s loved ones were urging her to think about moving on from the relationship. But Angela wouldn’t hear of it, and in the July 7 installment of the TLC show, she shocked her daughter and her grandchildren by introducing them to Michael in person for the first time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But her family hasn’t always been on board with her romance with a much younger man.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_51><a href=#>Angela’s daughter</a> Skyla has expressed skepticism about her mom’s romance with Michael and caused tension when she refused to serve as an egg donor for the couple. In the latest episode of 90 Day Fiancé, she urged Angela to accept that Michael might never be able to move to the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_15>“Mom, it’s just not meant to be if he’s not coming over here,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_15>“I can’t wait to prove you wrong that he’s gonna get that visa,” Angela replied.</p><p id=par-7_27>What Skyla didn’t realize was that not only had <a href=#>Michael finally received his visa</a>, but he was already in America. Angela couldn’t wait for the big reveal.</p><p id=par-8_18>“Skyla’s face … I cannot wait to say, ‘Look who’s coming for dinner,’” she said in a confessional.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-angela-s-grandchildren-meet-michael-on-90-day-fiance>Angela’s grandchildren meet Michael on ‘90 Day Fiancé’</h2><p id=par-9_35>Moments later, Michael, who was waiting outside in the car, knocked on the door of the home Angela shares with her six grandchildren and Skyla. They were stunned to finally meet their stepfather/stepgrandfather in person.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_24>“When I see Michael walk through the door, I was in total shock,” Skyla told producers in an interview. “I was not expecting that.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_16>Though the moment the family met Michael was a joyous one, Skyla still had some reservations.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_50>“But I do see that momma’s happy, that everybody is in a good mood, so I’m gonna ruin the moment, but from all the chaos that was going on, on the Ivory Coast, it’s really weird to see Momma sitting here and act like nothing has been wrong,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_68>So, who is part of Michael’s new family? In addition to Skyla, Angela lives with all six of her grandchildren. Three of the kids are Skyla’s and the other three belong to Angela’s other daughter, Scottie Deem. In 2019, Scottie – who no longer appears on 90 Day Fiancé &nbsp;– began serving a 20-year prison sentence on statutory rape and child molestation charges. She was released in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_21>90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? Season 8 airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on TLC.
