It wasn’t long until she realized that what she really wanted to do was become an actor. She began taking acting classes in Los Angeles.</p><p id=par-3_39>In 1985, she had her first breakout role in the film Prizzi’s Honor, a film directed by her father. She won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the role that set her on the path to stardom.</p><p id=par-4_38>For the next several years, Huston starred in many critically acclaimed films like The Dead, <a href=#>The Addams Family</a>, <a href=#>Witches</a>, and The Grifters. She also appeared in TV shows like Smash, And the Band Played On, and Lonesome Dove.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_24>Huston has also directed films like Bastard Out of Carolina, Agnes Browne, and Riding the Bus with My Sister which received positive critical acclaim.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-anjelica-huston-didn-t-become-a-mom>Why Anjelica Huston didn’t become a mom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/anjelica-huston-mom.jpg><p id=par-6_63>A couple of times in her life, Huston did consider having children. But it was never one of her top priorities. She began a volatile relationship with actor <a href=#>Jack Nicholson</a> in her early 20s and during their 17 years together, they did try to have a child. It didn’t happen and in hindsight, Huston told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulture</a> that it was a blessing in disguise.</p><p id=par-7_43>After ending her relationship with Jack Nicholson, Huston married sculptor Robert Graham in 1992.&nbsp; According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cinema</a>, Huston said that having a family was not high on their list of priorities. The couple tried to conceive unsuccessfully through IVF according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>.</p><p id=par-8_70>She explained there were times she wanted a family and other times she was grateful not to have one of her own. “I am a mess if I have to say goodbye to my dog for longer than five days,” she explained, comparing that to kissing her children goodbye as she left for work. “I don’t know if I could.” Huston was married to Graham until his death in 2008.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-anjelica-huston-avoided-family-patterns-by-not-becoming-a-mom>Anjelica Huston avoided family patterns by not becoming a mom</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_38>The unstable relationship Huston had with her father also played a part in her decision. He was often absent from her life when she was a child because of the demands of his career in the film industry.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_49>Her mother, Enrica Soma, was John Huston’s fourth wife and longest union until her death at 39 in a car accident. There were also complicated, extramarital affairs including one her father had with one of Anjelica Huston’s friends, Zoe Sallis. He had a son with Sallis, actor Danny Huston.</p><p id=par-11_49>Apparently, her father told Huston and her brother Tony about the “great news.” Huston told Vulture that she didn’t think it was great news she had a little brother. She was shocked. Two years after that, her mother gave birth to Allegra Huston whose father was John Julius Norwich.</p><p id=par-12_26>The patterns she saw in her family were ones she didn’t want to replicate in her own life. However, she and her siblings became close.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSur7bEpaCcmV2dwrTAzqdknaGUo8FuwMeipaRlk6TCrbCMoZinnJyaeqOxyKeeZq%2Bfp7iqusZmpKilXp3BrriO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
