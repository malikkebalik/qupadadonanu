That is a combined net worth with his wife, Hillary Clinton. Bill Clinton was the 42nd President of the United States, serving two terms from 1993 to 2001. When they left the White House, the Clintons were technically in debt due to Bill's legal expenditures. Over the next 10 years Bill alone earned $100+ million in speaking engagement fees alone. In 2001 he was paid the biggest book advance of all time, $15 million, for what became the best selling "My Life". To date Bill and Hillary have earned more than $250 million from speaking engagements, book advances/royalties, investment income and consulting fees. Perhaps as much as $300 million. In recent years the couple has earned $10 â€“ $30 million per year.</p><p>As part of her failed 2016 Presidential campaign, Hillary released 8 years of income tax returns. These returns showed that in 2014 the couple made $28 million, the majority of which came from speaking fees. In 2015 they made $10.6 million, of which $6 million was speaking fees. As a former President Bill is entitled to a $200,000 annual pension.</p><h2 id=clinton-income-history><strong>Clinton Income History</strong></h2><p>When they left the White House, the Clintons were technically in debt due to Bill's legal expenditures and sexual harassment settlement payments. In the decades after leaving the White House, Bill and Hillary have earned more than $250 million from speaking engagements, book advances/royalties, consulting engagements and investment income. If one assumes they earned at least $10 million in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, they've earned roughly $280 million since leaving the White House as you'll see in our chart below.</p><p>Before landing in the White House, Bill Clinton never earned more than $35,000 per year in salary as Attorney General and Governor of Arkansas. At the time Hillary was the bread-winner, bringing home around $110,000 in base salary when he was a partner at a Little Rock law firm. In the late 80s and early 90s before entering the White House she also typically earned around $60,000 per year from corporate board fees for total income of around $180,000.</p><p>During the first few years of Bill's Presidency, Hillary's income went to zero while he earned around $200,000 in base <a href=#>Presidential salary</a>. Their income jumped to $1 million 1996 thanks to royalties from the release of Hillary's book "It Takes A Village".</p><p>Below is a table listing the Clinton's annual gross income every year from 1991 to 2015 (they have not released tax records since 2016):</p><table width=394><tbody><tr><td colspan=2 width=156><strong>Bill and Hillary Clinton Annual Income</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Gross Income</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>$200,000</td></tr><tr><td>1992</td><td>$290,000</td></tr><tr><td>1993</td><td>$293,000</td></tr><tr><td>1994</td><td>$263,000</td></tr><tr><td>1995</td><td>$316,000</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>$1,065,000</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>$569,000</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>$569,000</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>$504,000</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>$416,000</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>$16,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>$9,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>$8,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>$20,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>$18,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>$16,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>$21,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>$5,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>$13,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>$15,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>$20,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>$27,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>$28,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>$11,000,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td><strong>$241,485,000</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296205 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/income.jpg alt width=879 height=511 sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296205 class=wp-caption-text>Clinton Income History</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III in Hope, Arkansas on August 19, 1946. His father unexpectedly died in an automobile accident three months before his birth. His mother Virginia Dell Cassidy moved to New Orleans to study nursing soon after his birth, and he was raised in Hope by his maternal grandparents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy. His mother returned in 1950 and married Roger Clinton Sr., and the family moved to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he grew up. Clinton almost immediately began using his stepfather's surname, and legally changed his name when he turned 15.</p><p>In 1963 Clinton visited the White House to meet then President John F Kennedy as a Boys Nation Senator. This moment combined with Dr Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech inspired a young Clinton to want to become a public official. Clinton would go onto to attend Georgetown University in Washington, DC, where he graduated with a degree in Foreign Service. After graduating he received a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford. From Oxford, Clinton went to Yale Law School. It was here where he met fellow Law school student&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Hillary Rodham</strong></a>, who he would later go on to marry. While at Georgetown, Clinton won elections for class president in 1964 and 1965. He also interned and clerked in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.</p><p>Bill married his wife Hillary Rodham on October 11, 1975. Their only child, daughter Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980. Bill is a grandfather to Chelsea's three children. Today, the Clintons live in Chappaqua, New York, in a home they purchased in 2016 for $1.6 million.</p><h2 id=political-career><strong>Political Career</strong></h2><p>After graduating from law school, Clinton moved back to his home state of Arkansas and began teaching as a law professor at the University of Arkansas. He ran for the House of Representatives in 1974, narrowly losing out to incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt. He then ran for Arkansas attorney general in 1976 with no opposition in the general election, and was thus elected to the position. A mere two years later, he became the youngest Governor in the country when he defeated Republican candidate Lynn Lowe at the age of 31, and took office when he was 32.</p><p>With his main focus being on education and healthcare reform, Clinton caught the eye of the nation. He was even looked upon to run for President in the 1988 election. By 1992 Clinton was ready to run. He won the 1992 presidential election and was elected into office over the incumbent President George Hubert Walker Bush, along with his Vice President <a href=# title="Al Gore Net Worth">Al Gore</a>. He served his first term as President from 1993 to 1997, and won his re-election campaign in the 1996 presidential campaign. He served his second presidential term from 1997 to 2001. During his time in office, he signed The Family and Medical Leave act of 1993, the Brady Bill, and expanded the earned income tax credit. He also appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: <a href=# title="Ruth Bader Ginsburg Net Worth">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> in 1993, and Stephen Breyer in 1994. He left the White House with the highest approval rating of any President since World War II, at 66%.</p><p>However, his time in the White House was not without its turbulent periods. Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998, by the House of Representatives. The House had voted 228-206 to impeach him on charges of perjury to a grand jury, and he was impeached a second time 221-212 for obstruction of justice. The impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had attempted to illegally obscure and cover up his affair with White House intern <a href=# title="Monica Lewinsky Net Worth">Monica Lewinsky</a>. Eventually, the Senate acquitted Clinton of both charges. He is the second US president ever to be impeached, the first being Andrew Johnson and the third being <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296201 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Bill-Clinton-1.jpg alt width=900 height=626 sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296201 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=post-presidency-earnings-philanthropy><strong>Post-Presidency Earnings and Philanthropy</strong></h2><p>Bill and Hillary would later admit that they had a negative net worth when they left the White House after incurring millions of dollars in legal fees as part of Bill's impeachment defense and sexual assault settlements. As soon as they were able, the Clintons hit the road to earn as much money as possible.</p><p>One of the first ways the Clintons cashed-in was through a book advance for Bill's memoir. Bill earned a $15 million advance for the rights to his memoir, smashing the the record for the <a href=#>biggest book advance</a> of all time. After adjusting for inflation, $15 million in 2001 is the same as around $21 million today which technically makes it the largest book advance of all time still, slightly edging out the $20 million <a href=# title="Barack Obama Net Worth">Barack Obama</a> earned in 2017 for his advance. Bill's book "My Life"was released in 2004.</p><p>Since leaving the White House in 2001, Bill Clinton has been a highly sought after and well compensated public speaker. Clinton earns between $150,000 and $700,000 per speech. His average fee is roughly $200,000. Between 2001 and 2013 alone, Bill Clinton earned <strong>$106 million</strong> in speaking engagement fees. In 2012, he earned $17 million off 73 speeches delivered around the world. Many of his earnings came from speeches that were delivered internationally, including one in Lagos, Nigeria, for which he earned a record $700,000.</p><p>When combined with Hillary's earnings, the couple generated around $280 million in income in the two decades since leaving the White House in debt.</p><p>He remains in the public eye with humanitarian work, which he runs mainly through The Clinton Global Initiative. Clinton has largely focused on issues such as HIV/Aids and global warming. Since the end of his presidency he has also been assigned a number of diplomatic missions, such as being named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009, and partnering with former President <a href=# title="George W. Bush Net Worth">George W. Bush</a>, under the then Obama administration, to coordinate fundraising efforts for Haiti following the devastating earthquake that occurred there in 2010.</p><p>Furthermore, he also returned to the campaign trail for the 2008 presidential election, when he advocated and campaigned on behalf of his wife Hillary. She ran against Barack Obama in the democratic presidential primary, losing out on the nomination. The Clintons returned in the 2016 presidential election, with Hillary running against Republication presidential candidate Donald Trump, eventually losing the spot to him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6sbvLoquim5mWu7R7z6ucrKGUmru1v46boKWkXZi5qrrTqKVmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
