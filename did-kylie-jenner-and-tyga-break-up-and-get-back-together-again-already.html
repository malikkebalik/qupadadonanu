Hollywood Life reported last Saturday that makeup mogul and <a href=#>wanna be mannequin</a> Kylie Jenner’s latest dead weight removal was boyfriend Tyga. Ssh, ssh – there there. I know. And hold on to something solid, dear readers, because the reason will rattle you to your core. Tyga, it turns out, may have been taking advantage of his 19-year-old multi-million dollar girlfriend!</p><p>Kylie Jenner, 19, reportedly&nbsp;dumped her longtime boyfriend,&nbsp;Tyga, 27, because&nbsp;she’s&nbsp;“fed up” with the rapper being irresponsible with his money. The power couple has been going strong for over a year and a half, but she allegedly wanted to make changes in her life. “It looks like Kylie HAS finished with Tyga, at least for now anyway,” a source close to the reality star tells&nbsp;HollywoodLife.com&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY.&nbsp;“She changes her mind like she changes her underwear though and Tyga has a habit of always managing to sneak his way back into her bed somehow.”</p><p>“Basically Kylie was bored with the relationship, she didn’t feel like it was going anywhere and after 18 plus months Tyga still hadn’t put a ring on it, so, you snooze, you lose,” our source added.&nbsp;“Kylie isn’t seeing anyone else, and she doesn’t think he was cheating, but she’s confident she can land herself a hotter,&nbsp;richer boyfriend.”&nbsp;It looks like he’ll have some competition!</p><p>Kylie and Tyga had their problems over the last year and a half, but they’ve managed to work out their differences. After&nbsp;their last big&nbsp;blowout, Kylie took her beau right back, so this must have been major!&nbsp;“Kylie felt that Tyga was taking advantage of her [financially],” according to&nbsp;MediaTakeOut. “Also she’s growing into a woman, and needed to make some changes in her life.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Hollywood Life]</a></p><p>For those of you playing at home, Tyga and Kylie <a href=#>have been down this path</a> before. Kylie has dumped his money-draining tuchus before. But those breaks lasted a New York Minute before she opened her home to him once more – and probably wrote a check to whichever <a href=#>landlord had kicked him out</a>. This time Kylie found two million reasons to let Tyga go – that being <a href=#>the amount of money the deadbeat supposedly owes her</a>. Adding fuel to the fire Saturday night, Kylie hit the town without Tyga looking fierce! Or as fierce as you can with a repurposed fishing net <a href=#>for an outfit</a>.</p><p>Alas, love is not yet dead. It looks like there is no need to turn her <a href=#>Tyga-inspired tattoo</a> into breakup poetry because the couple was back snapping selfies Monday and catching a movie <a href=#>with almost her whole family</a>. And you know what they say, anyone who is willing to put up with the Kardashian Klan in total must really need the cash. So did they or didn’t they? Is Kylie gunning for an engagement ring and did she put Tyga on notice? Or were they divvying up the ridiculously expensive cars <a href=#>they’ve gifted each other</a> when they realized they just couldn’t split? We may never care know.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FFN_BOA_Jenner_Kylie_021417_52315903-792x1024.jpg alt=FFN_BOA_Jenner_Kylie_021417_52315903 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FFN_FF9FF10_Kardashian_Family_012617_52295092-908x1024.jpg alt=FFN_FF9FF10_Kardashian_Family_012617_52295092 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FFN_Kylie_Jenner_CHP_02122017_52312565-998x1024.jpg alt=FFN_Kylie_Jenner_CHP_02122017_52312565 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: Instagram and WENN and Fame/Flynet Photos</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbmpnaYJze8Oim5ijqaG2pqvJnqWnnaKUrq%2Bwvq2woJmPl7%2BmrcqYrKmXkaOxoLPErZabmZOgrLW7xp6roZ2ilK6orcinlpqkopqupcWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
