The matchup is easily the most highly anticipated and hyped fight in boxing history. It's also already on pace to be the highest revenue-producing event in boxing history. As we detailed <a href=#>two days ago</a>, the Floyd/Manny bout is expected to break records in all four of boxing's major revenue-producing categories:&nbsp;<strong>1)</strong> Live Gate – money earned from selling tickets at the actual venue,&nbsp;<strong>2)</strong>&nbsp;Pay Per View,&nbsp;<strong>3)</strong>&nbsp;Foreign Rights, and&nbsp;<strong>4)</strong>&nbsp;Primary Sponsorship. And as the revenue streams start to overflow, the amount of money Mr. Mayweather is projected to earn from the night keeps adding up…</p><p>When the fight was first announced, we learned that Floyd and Manny would split all profits generated by the contest 60/40, with Floyd getting the 60. At the time, most analysts predicted that the fight would generate around $300 million in revenue. Of that $300 million, $50 million would go towards expenses, leaving Floyd and Manny with $150 million and $100 million, respectively. On the conservative end, most people agreed that Floyd would walk away with $120 million, and Manny would get $80 million.</p><p>These are all very large sums of money. But perhaps not large enough!</p><p>Earlier today, Manny's promoter revealed that Floyd's payday might actually be closer to $180 million! For one night's work! Win, lose or draw!</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-142758 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fl.jpg alt="(GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/Getty Images)" width=670 height=503 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-142758 class=wp-caption-text>(GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/Getty Images)</p><p>To give you some perspective on just how insane that is, consider the fact that <a href=# title="Derek Jeter Net Worth">Derek Jeter's</a> final contract with the Yankees paid him $189 million over 10 years!</p><p>Only 13 athletes in the history of sports have earned more from one contract than Floyd will likely take home on the evening of May 2nd.</p><p>If the $180 million number proves to be accurate, and it could go higher at any point, after taxes Floyd will be left with around $90 million. His career earnings will be approximately $520 million. His net worth will be approximately $390 million. Not bad for one night of work!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnCyy6iwnWWdlsa4scCtn56qXaK2qLTTZmhxaF2itq24yKilZp6ZnLW1tc2gZKaZnqPGbrzAnKiuoZGkfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
