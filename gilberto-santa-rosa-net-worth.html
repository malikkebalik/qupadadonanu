Gilberto Santa Rosa (CortÃ©s), also known as El Caballero de la Salsa (The Gentleman of Salsa), was born August 21, 1962 in Carolina, Puerto Rico. He took part in his first concert while still a teenager and in 1976, Gilberto made his recording debut as a backup singer with the Mario Ortiz Orchestra and was soon recruited by La Grande Orchestra, where he became the lead singer. Gilberto remained with the orchestra for two years, during which time he met Elias Lopez, who helped to mold and polish him as a singer. By 1986, he had his own band and was signed to Combo Records and a string of hits followed: Good Vibration, De Amor y Salsa (Of Love and Salsa), Punto de Vista (Point of View), Vivir Sin Ella (Living without Her) and Perspectiva. Gilberto Santa Rosa was the first singer of tropical salsa to carry out a concert at the Carnegie Hall Theater, in New York, where he performed as the opening number his unique version of the salsa tune Represento (I Represent). This event was recorded live at the hall, and later released as an album. In 1990, Gilberto joined the all-star La PuertoriqueÃ±a project which included Andy MontaÃ±ez.</p><p>That same year he was awarded the Billboard Lo Nuestro Award for Best Male Singer. During the 2000s, Gilberto continued to make albums, perform live and receive awards. In June 2008, 'Contraste' received Gold and Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and reportedly his album sold over 1,500,000 copies. On July 5, 2008, Gilberto became the first salsa singer to perform at the Palau de la MÃºsica in Barcelona-the event was sold out with an attendance of 2,000.
