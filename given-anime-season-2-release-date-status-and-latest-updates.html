Fans highly anticipated the anime’s second season. However, it was then confirmed that the anime would be adapted into a film. The film premiered on August 22nd, 2020.</p><p>The anime also aired a sequel. However, no word of a second season’s release has reached our ears yet. The second season will focus on the manga’s second version that we are certain of.</p><p>With the film selling 100,000 tickets in Japan, the animation wins over the public. Thus, the anime may receive a second season if all goes well. You may have to wait this year and maybe the following year.</p><p>We will keep you updated if something comes to our attention, fellas. You must be vigilant to do this. Our sources are working on obtaining the updates, so please be patient.</p><p>Continue watching the anime if you enjoyed it. And for those who haven’t seen it yet, I strongly encourage you to do so.</p><p><strong>Also check:</strong></p><h2>Given Anime Season 2 Plot</h2><p>The anime’s first season was action-packed, romantic, and enjoyable. Perhaps the second season will include a greater emphasis on each of them.</p><p>A more romantic story, pure enjoyment, and plenty of thrill are coming up. Keep your bottoms up! Season 2 will mostly focus on Aki and Haruki’s romance.</p><p>However, what occurs next is for you to discover, not for me to divulge, correct?
