It was really bad, like tiered tacky hideousness and not fashion-forward risky bad, and it made you wonder 1. how she thought it was ok to go out of the house like that and 2. how all the people she came into contact with allowed her to wear that dress without trying to talk her out of it. She looked like a cake topper.</p><p>Agron, 24, stars as no-longer pregnant former cheerleader Quin Fabray on Glee. I actually thought she was 18 or 19 and only just learned she was 24. She plays a teenager convincingly well and her poor taste in fashion made me believe she was much younger.</p><p>Somehow Agron <a href=#>scored a profile and slideshow in Vanity Fair</a>. Lainey at <a href=#>Lainey Gossip wonders how much rivalry</a> has to be going on behind the scenes on the Glee set now that Agron is taking some of the attention away from queen bee Lea Michele. I don’t think Michele has much to worry about, especially considering Agron’s complete failure to do much more than look gorgeous and wear an ugly dress at the Emmys. Lea <a href=#>owned that red carpet</a>.</p><p>Agron also sounds a little dumb in the interview, in that she likens her upcoming film, I Am Number Four, to “Rebel Without a Cause. With supernatural elements. And aliens.” Lainey <a href=#>read the book it’s based on</a> and thinks that’s so off the mark. In Lainey’s review she even wonders if Frey is spoofing other teen-focused supernatural books it’s so bad. <a href=#>Lainey wrote</a> “Some of the dialogue seems flagrantly – and hilariously – horrible. The overwrought interminable final battle scene becomes almost comical by the end. And the love story, the challenged romance between the supernatural and the human, sound familiar?… I have to believe [Frey is] taking the piss.” I guess we can’t expect Agron to grasp the subtleties of the book, especially if the director, Michael Bay, is “playing it straight” as Lainey mentions.</p><p>We’ll see if Agron is a contender, but from what I’ve seen of her so far the answer is no. Lea can stick her nose up on the red carpet and realize that she’s still running the show. Agron sure is lovely to look at though and I like that the other young Glee stars are getting some attention.</p><p>Photos via <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, where there are plenty more.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/agron2.jpg alt=agron2 title=agron2 width=430 height=562 sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/agron1.jpg alt=agron1 title=agron1 width=430 height=562 sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/view3.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/9628196/dianna-agron-arrives-the/dianna-agron-arrives-the.jpg border=0 width=500 title="Dianna Agron arrives at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles" height=818 oncontextmenu=return!1 ondrag=return!1 onmousedown=return!1 alt="Dianna Agron arrives at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles on August 29, 2010.
