Competitors are evaluated on how well they demonstrate technique, flavor and the holiday spirit.</p><p></p><h2>The Great British Baking Show’s Christmas special is even more enjoyable than the series’ regular Episodes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Great-British-Baking-Shows-Christmas-special.jpg><p>No one has 10 hours to spare during the holidays, but that doesn’t mean you have to watch a whole season of The Great British Baking Show to feel at ease. Its Christmas episode accomplishes this feat with flying colors, pitting an all-star ensemble of four bakers against one another in a winner-take-all competition to create a trio of seasonal goodies in just one hour.</p><p>Fans in the United Kingdom have become accustomed to two Christmas specials airing on Channel 4 each year: one on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day and another on New Year’s Day. Only eight-holiday episodes from the original series are available to view on Netflix at the moment. And because each episode stands on its own, you won’t feel obligated to watch them all at once. On November 18, Netflix will add two new holiday-themed episodes, which were actually produced in 2017. However, from a British perspective, this makes them episodes from the previous year.</p><p>The Great British Baking Show, or The Great British Bake Off as it is known in its home country and elsewhere Pillsbury does not own the “Bake Off” trademark, is a cooking competition show that has become immensely popular around the world.</p><p>I apologize for it, too. After its debut in 2010, the Great British Baking Show (GBBO) quickly established a global fan base thanks to its unique blend of suspense, delicious food, beautiful settings, and friendly amateur bakers. The holiday episodes are the cherry on top of an already delicious season of heartwarming baking successes and failures. (Once more, I sincerely apologize.)</p><p>There is far less pressure on the bakers (and on us) during the Christmas shows because of their one-and-done structure. Everyone seemed to be having a great time, despite the fact that the majority of the challenges still involve a mad sprint to complete everything on time.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>bring them back as the presenters <a href=# rel=noopener>#GBBO</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Ibp0lX7ozz</a></p><p>— ⛄️ (@minaraaa_) <a href=# rel=noopener>November 15, 2022</a></p><p>Former contestants like<a href=# rel=noopener> Rob Billington</a>, who famously dropped his multi-tiered showstopper cake in the opening episode of his season, are returning for the pleasure of it and perhaps to make up for mistakes they made in previous seasons. It gives viewers an opportunity to revisit the tent with their favorite participants, which is always appreciated. In addition, there is only one victor and a celebration for all participants.</p><h2>In November, you can watch The Great British Baking Show: Holidays Season 5 on Netflix</h2><p>The fifth season of “The Great British Baking Show: Holidays” has been confirmed. Starting this Friday, November 18th, you can watch the holiday season of TV’s nicest competition online via Netflix.</p><h2>What Makes this Holiday Episode Distinct from the Rest of the Season?</h2><p>Instead of a complete season, the Christmas special only has two episodes. Each two-hour episode features a baking competition with a seasonal twist. Two episodes in Season 5 will celebrate the holidays: one on Christmas and one on New Year’s Eve, the same as in previous seasons.</p><p>Traditional European Christmas desserts such as fruit crumbles, Christmas puddings, and miniature panettones were created by the participants in the 2016 episode.</p><p>Paul Hollywood, notorious for his harsh criticism, reportedly attempts to tone it down for the holiday episode. Will I be as strict while making decisions? In a word, no. Isn’t it the holiday season? That’s what the Hollywood teaser says.</p><h2>The Great British Baking Show: Holidays Season 5: Who are the Candidates?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Great-British-Baking-Show-Holidays-Season-5-Contestants.jpg><p>Past season’s celebrity bakers and contestants will return for this year’s holiday challenge. The “It’s a Sin” cast will put their baking skills to the test in the holiday episode. From the drama, Olly Alexander, Nathaniel Curtis, Lydia West and Shaun Dooley will be competing.</p><p>Favorite bakers from previous seasons will be making a comeback to compete in the New Year’s Eve show.
