He is best recognized for lending his baritone voice to innumerable commercials, trailers and TV shows. His work entails a six-decade career of voicing over multiple stands, thus becoming one of the most sought after voice actors. Hal Douglas was born Harold Cohen on September 1, 1924 in Stamford Connecticut. His mother died when he was only nine, so he and his brother Eddie were raised by his grandparents. Douglas joined the navy, where he served during World War II. He got his drama major from the University of Miami. Douglas began his career in radio in 1950 by producing voiceovers for various commercials, promos and trailers.</p><p>Ever since, he continued to lend his voice diligently building a fat portfolio in the process. Sometimes confused with <a href=# title="Don LaFontaine Net Worth">Don LaFontaine</a>, he made many voiceovers for documentaries and promotional voices for WB, Disney Channel, The History Channel, and A&E. Douglas made the introduction of most of his recordings "In a worldâ€¦" making this his catchphrase, even though there are controversies on whether it was him or LaFontaine the one who created the phrase. Douglas was based in New York City, and not in Los Angeles like most voice actors at the time. In 1988, Douglas moved to Lovettsville, Virginia where he built his own studio and got the chance to work from the comforts of his home. Douglas got married to Lois Barrett with whom he had two kids. He divorced Douglas to marry Ruth Francis, with whom he remained for 43 years until the day of his death on March 7, 2014. The cause of his death was pancreatic cancer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLWiuIydpq6fnJbAbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
