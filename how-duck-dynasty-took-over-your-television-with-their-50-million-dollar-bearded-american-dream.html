Walker/Getty Images</p><p>You are probably already familiar with the basic premise of "Duck Dynasty", even if you do not watch the show.&nbsp; When the program first launched in March of 2012, the story was that <a href=#>Phil Robertson</a>, the head of the Robertson family, was struggling financially in the early 70s, and needed a way to earn money for his family.&nbsp; He, his wife, and their four children, were based in Louisiana.&nbsp; They were a family of avid hunters and fishers and lived off the land.&nbsp; Sometime in the late 60s/early 70s, Phil Robertson created the "Duck Commander" duck call.&nbsp; He patented it in 1972, and began selling it.&nbsp; It became an instant favorite among duck hunters, and he launched his own business, the Duck Commander Company, the following year.&nbsp; The success of the Duck Commander made the Robertson family very wealthy, very quickly.&nbsp; Over the course of the next 30 years, they became the quintessential, backwoods, redneck millionaires.</p><p>As their family has expanded, adding wives and grandchildren, everyone has become part of the family business.&nbsp; <a href=#>Willie Robertson</a>, the third child born to Phil Robertson and his wife Kay, is now the CEO of Duck Commander.&nbsp; As CEO, he has significantly expanded the company's line.&nbsp; They now sell a range of hunting related merchandise, how-to videos, and clothing.&nbsp; <a href=#>Jase Robertson</a>, the second son born into the family, is in charge of manufacturing, and makes their duck calls by hand.&nbsp; Jep, the youngest, handles all things multi-media related, making all of their how-to videos and filming and editing their hunting instruction series.&nbsp; Alan, the oldest, spent most of his adult years working as a preacher, but has since returned to work for Duck Commander, in order to use their reality show to spread the gospel.&nbsp; In other words, the family is made for reality television.&nbsp; With their gruff, bearded exteriors, successful business, and seemingly drama-free family lives, they have quickly become reality television's most popular family.</p><p>"Duck Dynasty" has broken multiple television records with regards to viewership and premiere numbers, and it is proving to be an unstoppable ratings juggernaut.&nbsp; Even after Phil Robertson was suspended from the program briefly, after he made controversial remarks about homosexual behavior and African-Americans in a recent GQ interview, the show has continued to accumulate record numbers.&nbsp; Everyone loves watching the American Dream in action.</p><p>However, of late, there has been some trouble in paradise.&nbsp; While the Robertsons' success is certainly a demonstration of ingenuity and entrepreneurship, it is not quite the "rags-to-riches" story that A&E initially sold to the public.&nbsp; In fact, as more and more of the family's history comes to light, A&E has been quietly revising the life stories of the program's stars.&nbsp; Yes, Phil Robertson was, and is, an avid hunter and fisher, but rather than being all backwoods redneck, he was actually a clean-cut college athlete, who played football for Louisiana Tech University.&nbsp; He turned down an offer from the Washington Redskins, and after graduating with a degree in Physical Education, he earned a Masters in Education while simultaneously working full-time as a teacher.&nbsp; Willie Robertson graduated from the University of Louisiana at Monroe with a degree in Health and Human Performance/Business.&nbsp; The wives of the sons have degrees in Business and other money-related majors, and prior to the show, the entire family looked suspiciously like every other wealthy family in America – clean cut, buttoned-down, loafer-ed, and content.&nbsp; They summered on Martha's Vineyard, for pity's sake.</p><p>The success of the Duck Commander company certainly made them wealthy, but the success of their television program has made them stars.&nbsp; In order to achieve that level of fame, they had to be something more than simply wealthy and successful.&nbsp; The "Kardashian" and "Real Housewives…" franchises already had that branch of the reality television world sewn up.&nbsp; So, the way to set this television family apart was to embellish their past a bit.&nbsp; With the combination of big beards, lots of camouflage, and their small-town Louisiana location, the myth of "Duck Dynasty" came to life.&nbsp; Here was the ultimate American Dream on display.&nbsp; Never mind that it was mostly false.</p><p>The program now pulls in revenue of nearly $400 million per year for A&E and its co-producers.&nbsp; It's safe to say that the show is not going anywhere, any time soon.&nbsp; We all want to believe that miracles can happen, that we can become anyone we want to be, and that success is within reach.&nbsp; A&E has certainly found a great vehicle for peddling that idea.&nbsp; Audiences around the world seem to be lapping it up, even if the history we have been sold is fabricated and the redneck beards are meant to hide multiple degrees.&nbsp; Let's face it, we all want what the Robertsons have, and a good portion of the nation tunes in every Wednesday to live vicariously through them for just that reason.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJom66bm2KxurrArKuyZaSkvKx5056jnq6ZqLawuoxuZ2almaG5qrvNZpimnaKesKK6jJ2pnpmdZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
