The show is based on historian&nbsp;Stephen E. Ambrose’s 1992 non-fiction book of same name.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Spielberg and Hanks apparently read the book while making Private Ryan and considered it such a vital narrative that they convinced HBO to spend about $125 million to adapt the material into a show — the most expensive series ever produced at that time. Erik Jendresen served as the showrunner, with Spielberg giving final approval to each episode.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>The series scored rave reviews from critics and viewers, before winning seven Primetime Emmy awards and a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries or Television Film.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>And it seems HBO’s gamble is still paying off, as the miniseries recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted on Netflix as the sixth most-watched show</a> among United States viewers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true></figure><h2 id=h-how-long-will-it-take-to-watch-all-of-band-of-brothers data-injectable=false>How long will it take to watch all of Band of Brothers?</h2><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>Not long. Being that it’s a miniseries, the entire saga comprises only 10 episodes and a companion behind-the-scenes documentary — but no further seasons. That said, the individual episodes range from 49 to 70 minutes, so there aren’t any especially short chapters to ease your streaming schedule.</p><p data-characters=596 data-current-count=907 data-injectable=true>The miniseries dramatizes the true history of so-called “Easy” Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. The story tracks the group of soldiers from jump training all the way through their major actions in Europe until the end of World War II. Heavily based on Ambrose’s writing, the series uses the author’s research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans to tell its story. Interview excerpts of survivors are employed at the beginning of each episode, but the vets are not identified by name until the finale.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Band of Brothers is one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and if you haven’t seen it by now, lucky you! It’s just as harrowing as when it premiered more than 20 years ago, and its lessons have lost none of their potency.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Whether on Netflix or Max, formerly HBO Max, do yourself a favor and seek this one out. It was right here that many of us realized in the early days of the 21st century that TV could be just as powerful as film.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpJqmqWKysbXSqJueq12Wu6V50p6YrKeeqHqlu8SsZJuZnpl6sLKMm6morJiav7R5x5qtnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
