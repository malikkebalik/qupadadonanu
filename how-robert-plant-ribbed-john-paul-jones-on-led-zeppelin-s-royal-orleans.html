On Zep’s seventh studio album, you hear neither acoustic guitar nor keyboards. It’s strictly an electric-guitar record and probably the <a href=#>most metal album the Zep recorded</a>.</p><p id=par-2_42>Looking back on its production in ’77, Led Zeppelin founder <a href=#>Jimmy Page</a> said Presence was “a reflection of the total anxiety and emotion” for everyone involved. If you dig into biographical data of the band members, you’ll see exactly what Page meant.</p><p id=par-3_41>For starters, Robert Plant worked on tracks such as “Achilles Last Stand” and the pitch-black “Nobody’s Fault But Mine” <a href=#>while confined to a wheelchair</a>. Indeed, at the time, doctors couldn’t be sure Plant would go back to walking without a limp.</p><p id=par-4_44>But Zeppelin did manage to brighten the mood somewhat on two Presence tracks. On “<a href=#>Candy Store Rock</a>,” the band unleashed its own potent brand of rockabilly. And on “Royal Orleans” Plant told a story full of in-jokes intended to embarrass bandmate John Paul Jones.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Robert Plant told the story of John Paul Jones’ adventure with a drag queen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/led-zep-live.jpg><p id=par-5_57>As with many Led Zeppelin stories, the tale that inspired “Royal Orleans” is a mix of fact and fiction. But it’s one of the more entertaining episodes in the accounts of band’s touring days. And as you can guess it began on a wild night in New Orleans, a favorite destination of the band’s while on tour.</p><p id=par-6_54>While staying at the French Quarter’s Royal Orleans Hotel, the band made its usual round of Bourbon Street haunts, including some gay and drag-queen bars. In Plant’s lyrics, a member of the Zep party didn’t realize a transvestite (dubbed “Whiskers”) was a man. (“If you take your pick, be careful how you choose it.”)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_46>According to Jones, that wasn’t him but another member of Zep’s entourage in another country entirely. But Plant wasn’t writing a nonfiction account here, so he brought that into the story as well. What did happen to Jones provided an equally fun part of the song.</p><p id=par-8_41>The band members were friendly with the drag queens, and Jones was hanging out with a character named Stephanie. Late that night, after smoking a joint in his room at the Royal Orleans, Jones and Stephanie fell asleep. A near-disaster followed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jones said he set fire to his room before he and a drag queen escaped</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/robert-plant-john-paul-jones-stage.jpg><p id=par-9_45>As Plant sings his story about “a man I know [who] went down to Louisiana,” he mixes in references to both parts of the story. When he mentions “John Cameron,” that was the name of a rival of Jones’ from his session days in London.</p><p id=par-10_57>But the part about how “fire preceded water” and how “Poor Whiskers set that room alight” actually happened to Jones. “We rolled a joint or two and I fell asleep and set fire to the hotel room, as you do, haha,” Jones told <a href=#>Mojo</a> in 2007. “And when I woke up it was full of firemen!”</p><p id=par-11_44>Afterwards, the hotel manager called Zep’s manager to assure him everything was all right. So when a roadie checked in on Jones he discovered the embarrassing episode. And he made sure to get the details to Plant, who relished ribbing Jones with his lyrics.</p><p id=par-12_43>Plant has a few golden lines in this track, real or imagined. “When I step out, strut down with my sugar,” he sings, “She’d best not talk like Barry White.” Don’t let anyone tell you Led Zeppelin didn’t have a sense of humor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMq6abnaKperG4wKerZqqZl6%2BmsIyjpqGmXaWutriMo6annaNivK95y56bZrKVpb2muMinqmaqn66urXnOq6OemZ6oe6nAzKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
