Unsurprisingly, it can be difficult to figure out <a href=# class=T3D>how to stay awake until midnight</a> after the last few months of festive cheer. I can't be the only one still recovering from the crafty chaos of Halloween, the food comas of Thanksgiving, and the crazy <a href=# class=T3D>holiday gift-giving</a>. And now I have to clap and cheer when the clock strikes 12? Oh, alright.</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I'm totally stoked for the new year and what it has to offer. After all, 2015 has been pretty great. From amazing <a href=# class=T3D>feminist milestones</a> to an assortment of <a href=# class=T3D>body posi moments</a>, 2015 was quite the game changer. I can only imagine just how <a href=# class=T3D>2016 will be the best year</a> for all of us.</p><p>Personally, I'll have to work a little harder to keep the festive cheer going and <a href=# class=T3D>make the most of the holidays</a>. I know I can't be the only one. Fortunately, once I get inspired by these <a href=# class=T3D>new year quotes</a>, I think I'll be good to go.</p><p>To top it off, I brainstormed some hacks to help me stay awake on New Year's Eve. This way, I can <a href=# class=T3D>welcome the new year</a> in person, <a href=# class=T3D>sequin dress</a> and all. Looking to do the same? Start off with these six simple hacks to stay up until midnight. Happy 2016!</p><h3>1. Nap</h3><p>Want to re-adjust your sleep schedule? Focus on the most significant part: sleep. Take a nap during the day, and rest your body in preparation for the night's festivities. If you're busy during the day or have to work, get some shut eye in the evening. Even a 30-minute cat nap can work wonders; <a href=# class=T3D>daytime rest</a> just doesn't get the credit it deserves.</p><p>Alternatively, if your schedule allows it, consider leaving bed later than usual. It's basically the perfect excuse to hit the snooze button a few extra times.</p><h3>2. Drink Coffee</h3><p>Ah, coffee. There's nothing quite like a good cup of java to keep you going. Personally, it makes me feel like a semi-normal person each and every morning. Fellow caffeine addicts, I know you know what I mean.</p><p>Luckily, coffee makers work during all times of the day. Consider sipping on a fresh cup around 5 or 6 p.m. to keep you going until the ball drops. You don't even need to finish all of it; a little bit can do the trick.</p><h3>3. Avoid Sugary Foods</h3><p>When it comes to the holidays, there's nothing like indulging in delicious grub. There's a reason why the "itis" is a thing. But when it comes to staying awake on New Year's Eve, a food coma is something you could certainly do without.</p><p>Prep yourself by skipping the sugary snacks and treats; this will prevent a sugar high followed by the inevitable crash. Instead, opt for protein-rich foods such as peanut butter, mixed nuts, and Greek yogurt. This will give you longer-lasting fuel without the drastic drop in energy.</p><h3>4. Mind the Champagne</h3><p>If you drink alcohol, you know all about the drowsiness that comes along with consuming booze. Want to make sure you're wide awake at midnight? Take it easy with the champagne on New Year's Eve.</p><p>I get it — you're just trying to celebrate. But when it comes to hyping yourself up for the ball drop, pacing yourself is the best thing you can do. Remember, slow and steady wins the race.</p><h3>5. Play a Game</h3><p>The best way to keep your brain moving and grooving is to play a game. I'm talking about everything from good old board games to a few rounds of trivia. If the game is super social, that's even better! The human interaction and stimulation will make sure you're in tip-top shape for midnight.</p><h3>6. Stay Active</h3><p>Frequent movement and light activity can be the key to staying up until midnight. Don't worry — I'm not suggesting an entire workout regime on New Year's Eve. However, moving around can really help up your energy level. Even something as simple as walking around a party can do the trick.</p><p>Extra points for taking on a semi-active game, like pool or darts.</p><p><i>Looking for more holiday cheer?
