She didn’t tell her boyfriend or husband. He came home. He was pissed off,” Baker told Showbiz Cheat Sheet. “Literally, I was there. [He said] like what the f*** did you do?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Hugh-Hefner-1.jpg><p id=par-4_27>Madison alleged that Hefner screamed at her and said the haircut “made me look old, hard and cheap.” Baker said Hefner may have said those things.</p><p id=par-5_62>“Did he call her old? He might have said that, but not in public,” Baker said. “And you know, he was pissed. I always give the analogy if I <a href=#>came home to my wife</a> and had shaved my head bald and I said ‘Hi honey, how do you like my new look?’ You know, what would she say? She’d be speechless.”</p><p id=par-6_32>“Anyway, he was speechless,” Baker recalled. “He was pissed. And guess what? I played cards with him two hours later and he forgot about it. They forgot to put that in there.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-holly-madison-made-11-million-off-of-playboy-jonathan-baker-says>Holly Madison made $11 million off of Playboy, Jonathan Baker says</h2><p id=par-7_58>Baker said he was <a href=#>often at the Playboy mansion</a> when Madison became one of Hefner’s girlfriends. “Well, I mean, I was there when Holly was there. I was there when she showed up, She worked very hard. Remember there were seven girls. She was at the end. She worked her way up to number one,” he recalled.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_57>Baker said Madison worked hard to become Hefner’s number one. And she made bank too. “She made $11 million dollars off a Playboy. Eleven million dollars. How dare she talk like this! She was a kid. [But] yes, she grew up. Yes, she wanted things. Yes, he wouldn’t give her the baby. And yes, she left.”</p><p id=par-9_76>“But he gave her two shows, gave her the power to be a Playboy director of the Playmates at one point. She did a great job. I like Holly. I thought Holly was a keeper. She wasn’t the prettiest of them all. But she was definitely present and she did great things for the mansion. I thought she cleaned it up. She made everything that was ugly, fun again. She had some style, you know?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hugh-hefner-s-former-girlfriend-said-he-spoke-abrasively-to-holly-madison>Hugh Hefner’s former girlfriend said he spoke abrasively to Holly Madison</h2><p id=par-10_31>In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">documentary</a>, Hefner’s former girlfriend&nbsp;Bridget Marquardt&nbsp;said the rules seemed to be different for Madison. “Hef would be pretty abrasive in the way he said things to Holly,” she remarked.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_81>“She came down <a href=#>with red lipstick one night</a> and he flipped out and said he hated red lipstick on girls, [telling her], ‘You need to take it off right way,’ even though other people could wear red lipstick and it didn’t seem to bother him. It was very frustrating to live with every day, all of the drama that was going on and the tensions. I could definitely see that she&nbsp;was getting depressed and sad,&nbsp;and her demeanor was starting to change.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1trPHZp%2Benp6av27DwKxkppmUYrWwuMuyZKaZlJ7AsLqMnKytZZiav260wKKpZpqlqXqxuMCynJ1lk5a%2Fpb%2BMra6oZZikwrO%2FjKWYrZ2iYq6vsIyfpqufn6l6oq7OrqtmoaRis7O1xKebZqqVmK6tuNJmnLGbnKrAqsLEZ5%2BtpZxk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
