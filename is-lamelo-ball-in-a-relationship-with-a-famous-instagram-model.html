In the 2020 NBA draught, the Hornets used the third overall pick on him. In 2021, Ball was crowned NBA Rookie of the Year and in 2022, he was selected as an NBA All-Star.</p><h2>LaMelo Ball Early Life</h2><p>Ball’s parents, both of whom played basketball at the collegiate level, gave birth to him in Anaheim, California. LaVar Ball began coaching his son, Ball, in basketball the moment he could run. When he was four years old, he began playing basketball alongside his elder brothers Lonzo and LiAngelo, against competitors who were decades his senior.</p><p>At the age of five, he played flag football with his brothers, but he mostly stuck to basketball. Ball joined his parents’ 17-and-under <a href=# rel=noopener>Amateur Athletic Union</a> (AAU) team, Big Ballers VXT, in 2013 when he was in the seventh grade. Since they weren’t backed by any big-name sneaker brand, the squad never made it to the big stages of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and instead stuck to the smaller tournaments in their hometown.</p><h2>LaMelo Ball’s Career</h2><p>In the upcoming NBA draught in 2020, Ball was predicted to be selected first overall. The Charlotte Hornets used the third overall pick in the 2020 NBA draught to choose Ball. The draught was conducted on November 18, 2020. In the 2017 NBA draught, he and his brother Lonzo were the first brothers to be selected in the top three picks by different teams. Lonzo was picked second overall.</p><p>Having had a mixed preseason, he started the regular season on the bench. On December 23, 2020, Ball made his NBA debut in a 121-114 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played in 16 minutes and did not score, but he did grab one rebound and dish out three assists and made two steals.</p><h2>Who is LaMelo Ball Dating?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lamelo-Ball-Girlfriend.jpg><p>He is currently dating Ana Montana, a professional model from the United States. This couple can’t seem to stop posting stunning photos of each other on Instagram.</p><p>They also live together in the same house. The <a href=# rel=noopener>Charlotte Hornets</a> player recently posted a photo of himself and his girlfriend, Ana to Instagram.</p><p>In the photos that LaMelo has uploaded, he is dressed in all black and has an air of sophistication. He looked dapper in a dazzling necklace and bracelet, both of which he wore on his left hand. A black baseball cap and a pair of pink sneakers were the finishing touches on his ensemble.</p><h2>Ana Montana’s Career</h2><p>Ana Montana is, for those who are unaware, a professional model. Analicia Chaves is another name she uses. She has appeared in the music video for the song “Dope” by rapper T.I. As of right now, Montana’s Instagram account has approximately 2.4 million followers. According to her bio, she represents the Fashion Nova brand.</p><p>Ana’s Instagram page was filled with photos from her travels around the world, shots from professional photoshoots, and intimate group shots with friends and family.</p><h2>How Long Has LaMelo Ball Been a Basketball Player?</h2><p>On August 22, 2001, in Anaheim, California, LaMelo was born. Both of his parents, LaVar and Tina Ball, played college basketball. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that basketball is deeply ingrained in the DNA of the Balls.</p><p>As soon as Ball could walk, his father started putting him through basketball drills. At age 4, he began playing basketball with his older brothers Lonzo and LiAngelo. He tried his hand at flag football when he was five years old, but basketball was always his first love.</p><p>Keep following <a href=# rel=noopener>venturejolt.com</a> for more updates.
