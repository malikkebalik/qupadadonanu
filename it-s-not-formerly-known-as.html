She worked as a backup dancer for major artists, appearing in music videos for artists such as Kylie Minogue, <a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a>, and Jessie J in the early 2010s.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_52>Twigs launched her own music career in 2012 with her debut EP&nbsp;EP1, followed by EP2 the following year. She released her debut album&nbsp;LP1&nbsp;in 2014, which included the popular singles “Two Weeks” and “Video Girl.” She was praised for her unique take on R&B sounds and the way she blended various genres together.</p><p id=par-4_23>Twigs returned to the music scene in 2019 with&nbsp;her second full-length album Magdalene. In early 2022, she released her debut mixtape Caprisongs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>The meaning behind FKA twigs’ name</h2><p id=par-5_45>Like her music, even FKA twigs’ name has an interesting background. In 2013, the up-and-coming songstress was profiled in an article for&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Pitchfork</a>. She revealed that she had gotten the name Twigs because of how her joints crack when she stretches her arms and legs.</p><p id=par-6_66>She added the letters “FKA” to her name when another sister duo&nbsp;The Twigs asked her to change her stage name. The Twigs have been active since 1994 and even brought a legal case against the “cellophane” singer about her name. And while many believe she added “FKA” to stand for “Formerly Known As,” she stated in a 2014&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Dazed</a>&nbsp;interview that that couldn’t be further from the truth.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_69>“I was actually gonna be AFK twigs, but then somebody said to me, ‘that stands for ‘Away From Keyboard’, and I was like ‘Oh my God! Away From Keyboard twigs?’ I know I’m aloof, but that’s pushing it a bit too far!” she said. “I just swapped around two of the letters to FKA twigs. And I was pretty annoyed about that anyway, but I got used to it.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_91>“I didn’t realize that FKA stood for ‘formerly known as.’ And then&nbsp;The&nbsp;Twigs said that because I’m saying ‘formerly known as twigs’, that means that once I was called ‘twigs’, and so I can’t be called twigs now,” she continued. “The only way I won’t have to change my name is if they say that I don’t have to. And they’re not gonna say that. I’m not angry, but I do feel sad about it. It’ll be fine. I might call myself FKA tree trunk. Or FKA baby branches. Or IRL twigs.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>FKA twigs released her mixtape ‘Caprisongs’ in 2022</h2><p id=par-9_27>Today, FKA twigs has become a household name, performing alongside the likes of <a href=#>Dua Lipa</a> and collaborating with music stars such as <a href=#>The Weeknd</a> and Shygirl.</p><p id=par-10_46>In January 2022, twigs released her debut mixtape Caprisongs in celebration of Capricorn season, released just days before her 34th birthday.
