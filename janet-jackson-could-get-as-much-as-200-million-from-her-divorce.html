We learned over the weekend that <a href=#>they had split just months</a> after Janet had given birth to their son. While there still is no official announcement, everyone’s going with the story because “Jackson family sources” are leaking all over the place. According to People Mag’s sources, Janet and Wissam split “shortly after their son Eissa was born in January” because:</p><p>“They separated shortly after the baby was born. The cultural differences between her and Wissam became even more obvious [after Eissa arrived]. They come from very different worlds. For years, Janet tried to adapt to his culture. Since it’s not a culture she grew up with, it’s been challenging for her. She often felt she disappointed Wissam.”</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>I can understand that. I can understand how you fall in love with a guy, it’s all romance and money and parties and you end up getting married and then… the pregnancy and baby changes everything. Suddenly there are all of these rules and you feel like your husband and his religion are setting you up to fail. As for the money… I said yesterday that I didn’t think money would be some big issue between them. She’s rich, he’s rich, what do they have to fight about? Well, it seems like there was a prenup… and now that she made it to the five-year mark, she gets a huge pay-day??</p><p>She’s in control — and in the money. Janet Jackson’s split from filthy rich Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana could net her up to $200 million under terms of their prenup, multiple family sources said. She was entitled to $100 million if they stayed married for at least five years, family sources told The Post. Jackson and Al Mana announced their marriage in January 2012 but might have been secretly married as early as December 2011.</p><p>The prenup also calls for that $100 million payment to be doubled if they have a child — which became so three months ago with the birth of their son Eissa.</p><p>“It looks like a money grab but it’s not about money,” a relative of the “Control” singer Jackson said. “She’s never in a relationship too long. Her longest was [musician] Rene [Elizonda] and that was for [nearly] 10 years [1991-2000]. Marriage doesn’t agree with her. She doesn’t agree with marriage.”</p><p>A long-time security guard for the Jackson family agreed, saying money isn’t the driving force here — and that Janet didn’t like Al Mana’s conservative ways.</p><p>“She loves to be in control,” the family confidante said. “She ceded that control [in marriage] and she was not happy about it. She wants to get back to being Janet Jackson and not Mrs. Wissam Al Mana or being the obedient Muslim wife.”</p><p>A $200 million payout would be a brutal — but far from crushing — bottom-line blow to Al Mana, who is worth $1 billion, according to an estimate by money-and-celeb site The Richest. The hubby’s Al Mana Group has vast holdings in cars, real estate, retail, tech and other ventures. Jackson is worth a mere $150 million, The Richest estimated.</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>$200 million for five years and a baby? Hm… I mean, what I have even done in the past five years that I couldn’t have done while also waiting out that $200 million pay-day??? Now, I doubt Wissam will end up cutting Janet a check for $200 million. It will be negotiated down to something more manageable, especially if Wissam agrees to some terms about how the baby will be raised. Also: yeah, I don’t think Janet is meant to be married.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FFN_SGP_Versace_1_022213_51020622.jpg alt="Milan Fashion Week - Versace Show" width=490 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame/Flynet and WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbmthZX90e8mapZ6sj5%2BupLfSqKWYm5%2BquaWrxp6rmJmjlLq2r8eYmKyXYmV9oLnIpaOip56Us7O7zJifnqqPmba3u9GcnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
