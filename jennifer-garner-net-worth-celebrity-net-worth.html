After a few smaller roles in projects like, "Pearl Harbor" and "Catch Me If You Can", she became a household name when she was cast in the hit series, "Alias" in 2001. Her five seasons on "Alias" led to higher profile film work. Today Jennifer Garner is probably best known for starring in movies like "13 Going on 30," "Catch and Release," "Juno," "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past," "Valentine's Day," "The Odd Life of Timothy Green," "The Dallas Buyers Club," "Daredevil," and "The Adam Project" among many more.</p><p>Jennifer Garner is also a highly-paid product endorser for brands like Capital One and Neutrogena. On the entrepreneurial front, Jennifer is the co-founder of the baby food company "Once Upon A Farm," which we discuss in greater detail later in the article.</p><h2 id=early-life><b>Early Life</b></h2><p>Jennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972, in Houston, Texas. Her father, William, was a chemical engineer, and her mother was a homemaker turned college English teacher. When she was three, Garner moved with her parents and two sisters to Charleston, West Virginia. She grew up in a conservative household, attending a local Methodist Church every Sunday and Vacation Bible School. The teenagers were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears, or dye their hair.</p><p>Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio after graduating from George Washington High School in 1990. After three years, she changed her major from chemistry to theater and spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute in Waterford, Connecticut.

She nabbed her first leading role in the TV movie "Rose Hill", and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama "Washington Square." She was involved in the <a href=# title="Woody Allen Net Worth">Woody Allen</a> film "Deconstructing Harry", but most of her performance was cut from the final edit of the film. Garner was cast in J.J. Abram's popular college drama "Felicity" in 1998, which was her most significant role yet. She played minor roles in big-name movies like "Dude, Where's My Car?" in 2000 and in 2001's war epic "Pearl Harbor."</p><p>2001 proved to be a turning point in Garner's career, when she starred as Sydney Bristow in ABC's "Alias." J.J. Abrams, the show's creator, had written the part with her in mind. "Alias" aired for five seasons, with Garner's salary rising slowly until it was $150,000 per episode by the end of the series. The show was successful amongst audiences and critics alike, and Garner received many award nominations and wins for her performance.</p><p>While she was working on "Alias", she continued to work intermittently in film. After being wowed by her performance in "Alias", <a href=# title="Steven Spielberg Net Worth">Steven Spielberg</a> called personally to offer her a small role in 2002's "Catch Me if You Can."

Shortly after, she became a spokesperson for skincare line Neutrogena.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-294209 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Jennifer-Garner-1.jpg alt="Jennifer Garner Net Worth" width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-294209 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Alberto E.

The film saw modest monetary success and was met with mixed reviews.&nbsp; Garner worked with <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey in 2013's drama Dallas Buyer's Club</a>, where she portrayed the role of a doctor treating Texas AIDS patients during the '80s. She once again was praised critically by reviewers and fans alike for her sensitive and poignant performance.</p><p>Garner has continued to hone her acting craft and appear in major roles on and off throughout the 2010s. She is often praised for her ability to connect with audiences on emotional and humorous levels. In August 2018, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2019, it was announced that she would produce and star in "Yes Day," a Netflix comedy directed by Miguel Arteta. She then appeared in 2022's "The Adam Project" before becoming a series regular in the revival of Starz's "Party Down." Garner also executive produced and took on the role of Hannah Hall in the Apple TV+ series "The Last Thing He Told Me."</p><h2 id=alias-salary><strong>Alias Salary</strong></h2><p>How much did Jennifer Garner make for "Alias"? For early seasons she earned $45,000 per episode which worked out to around $1 million for the full 22-episode season. By the end of the show's run, Garner's peak salary was $150,000 per episode, roughly $3.3 million for season.</p><h2 id=other-salaries><strong>Other Salaries</strong></h2><p>Jennifer's salary for 2004's "13 Going on 30" was $3 million.</p><p>For 2007's "The Kingdom", Garner was paid $7 million. That same year she appeared in "Juno", for which she accepted a nominal upfront salary in exchange for a percent of the movie's backend gross.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-263155 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Jennifer-Garner.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-263155 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=capital-one-earnings><strong>Capital One Earnings</strong></h2><p>How much does Jennifer Garner get paid to appear in Capital One commercials? Typically a high-profile actor like Jennifer does not earn a salary per commercial with a brand like Capital One. Instead, she will sign a long-term contract that covers a set number of commercials per year. Based on comparable actor's known endorsement contracts, Garner is likely operating under a 5-year $15-20 million deal to work with Mercedes. That's $3-4 million per year if you want to think of it that way. But the money is likely paid upfront.</p><h2 id=once-upon-a-farm><strong>Once Upon A Farm</strong></h2><p>Jennifer is the co-founder of the organic baby food company Once Upon A Farm. The brand was founded in 2017. She also serves as Chief Brand Officer.

She is an ambassador and serves on the board of trustees for Save the Children, which promotes national literacy and early education efforts. She frequently visits families involved in the Early Steps to School Success program, which helps families get assistance with early childhood education.</p><p>While Jennifer has stated she is not an overly political person, she has donated to various democratic politicians including Wendy Davis. Garner also hosted two fundraisers for <a href=# title="Barack Obama Net Worth">Barack Obama</a> in 2008, and a fundraiser in support of <a href=# title="Hillary Clinton Net Worth">Hillary Clinton</a> in 2016.</p><p>Garner is vocally supportive of laws that protect children of celebrities from paparazzi.

This was actually a vastly reduced price from the original listed fee of $27.5 million. The seller was super-producer <a href=# title="Brian Grazer Net Worth">Brian Grazer</a>. The ranch consists of five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, high ceilings, massive picture windows that lend a sense of openness to the entire house, a guesthouse, a swimming pool, a gym, a half basketball court, an office/studio, and gorgeous views. The house has an incredible history as well.
