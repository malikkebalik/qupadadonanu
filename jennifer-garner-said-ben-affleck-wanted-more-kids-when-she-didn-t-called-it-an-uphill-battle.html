While the couple went their separate ways in 2018, they retained a friendship for the good of their kids. Now, Affleck reportedly lives in a $100,000 monthly rental away from his wife, Jennifer Lopez, and closer to Garner and his children.</p><p id=par-3_34>Before Garner and Affleck split, Garner answered questions regarding how she and Affleck parent while still working in Hollywood. She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Extra</a> that Affleck was a fantastic father while she stayed busy filming.</p><p id=par-4_51>“Ben took a break,” Garner said. “He came, he did the school drop-offs and pickups and bedtimes and brought the kids to see me every day on set. And he gave me that gift. Otherwise, it would’ve been really hard for me to do. He’s great. … He’s a great dad.”</p><p id=par-5_14>The interviewer asked Garner how she felt about possibly having a fourth child.</p><p id=par-6_44>“I read somewhere that we were thinking of having another,” Garner said. “The fact that Ben wants another is true. … But, I can tell you that that would be a pretty uphill battle with me. I am not anticipating having any more kids.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-argo-star-said-3-is-good-when-it-comes-to-his-children>The ‘Argo’ star said ‘3 is good’ when it comes to his children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ben-Affleck-Jennifer-Garner-Seraphina.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-7_37>Jennifer Garner clarified that Ben Affleck wanted more than three kids when she didn’t. Affleck also received the question regarding possible family expansion from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Extra</a> that same year. During the interview, he contradicted what Garner said.</p><p id=par-8_21>The interviewer told Affleck that “rumors” suggested he “could be a daddy again soon.” To that, he responded, “I hope not.”</p><p id=par-9_28>“If that happens — no, it’s not going to happen,” he continued. “We’re in a good place. Three is good. That’s enough. That’s too much, actually, for me.”</p><p id=par-10_42>When it comes to family, Affleck added that he “tries” his “best” to be a loving, caring father and fantastic husband. “There’s a nice grounding thing to having a family and having that at the center of your life,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-lopez-allegedly-wanted-to-have-a-baby-with-ben-affleck>Jennifer Lopez allegedly wanted to have a baby with Ben Affleck</h2><p id=par-11_49>Ben Affleck has three kids with Jennifer Garner, and Jennifer Lopez has twins with her ex, Marc Anthony. Lopez and Affleck don’t have any children as a couple. However, a source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Life & Style</a> in April 2024 that Lopez wanted to have a baby with Affleck via surrogate.</p><p id=par-12_45>“She nagged him until he went along with it,” the source claimed. “Ben was completely&nbsp;happy with the blended family&nbsp;they already have — but he loves kids, that’s why he agreed to having another. At the end of the day, he wants Jennifer to be happy.”</p><p id=par-13_46>The source added that Lopez “obsessed” over “every detail” and planned to interview surrogate candidates. “She talks about it nonstop,” they claimed. “Ben figures it’s easier to go along with her, but he’s realizing what he’s gotten himself into. It’s just going to get more hectic!”</p><p id=par-14_30>Of course, Affleck and Lopez have been in the news for their alleged impending divorce. With this in mind, it seems unlikely that they are chasing the dream of surrogacy.</p><p id=par-15_13>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, follow&nbsp;<a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3prrNop2eql2crrO6xKtkrJmZmXqjsc1mmJ%2BenJqwrHnWmqWtnZRiurC%2BxGaiopyjYruwwIycmKWklZl6trzHoqOlZZKWwbW4xGefraWcZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
