As someone who has been on two “big network shows,” she said the difference doesn’t come down to swearing or sex scenes but the sheer number of episodes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_45>“It wasn’t so much about being able to swear, as it was that they have the time and the luxury of only doing 10 episodes,” she said. “There’s no beating clock saying, ‘We need Episode 5!’ There’s no filler episode because we’re only doing 10.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_15>The actor continued, saying she witnessed just how difficult it could be delivering many episodes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_53>“I always felt so bad for the writers on The Good Wife and ER. They never had a break. They’re always writing, writing, writing, writing,” she said, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Empire</a>. “We would get two-month hiatuses, they would only get three weeks to take a break. How can you keep coming up with new stuff?”</p><p id=par-6_24>She followed up with “How can you refresh? How can you keep going?” noting that streaming typically requires actors to shoot 10 episodes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-julianna-margulies-sopranos-stint-involved-jokes-about-er-with-james-gandolfini-and-michael-imperioli>Julianna Margulies’ ‘Sopranos’ stint involved jokes about ‘ER’ with James Gandolfini and Michael Imperioli</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Anthony-Edwards-George-Clooney-and-Julianna-Margulies-on-the-set-of-ER.jpg><p id=par-7_50>After <a href=#>walking away from ER</a> Margulies went on to play Julianna Skiff in The Sopranos Season 6. She appeared in four episodes, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, between 2006 and 2007. While filming the hit HBO series she used to joke with members of the cast about how many episodes they’d filmed.</p><p id=par-8_64>“I used to joke with Michael Imperioli and James Gandolfini – I had done 160 episodes of ER, I hadn’t done The Good Wife yet, but I’d done 156 episodes of that – that their six seasons took 10 years to make,” she said. “Six seasons! I don’t even think they got to 40 episodes in six seasons, and I had done 156 episodes.</p><p id=par-9_33>“That is such a difference between streaming and network. I really don’t think I could ever do another network show after experiencing what it’s like to have the luxury of time,” she added.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-julianna-margulies-now-stars-on-the-morning-show-with-reese-witherspoon-and-jennifer-aniston>Julianna Margulies now stars on ‘The Morning Show’ with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/TheMorningShow/status/1444001180619657217</p></figure><p id=par-10_59>After her recurring role on The Sopranos Margulies is now in the world of streaming.
