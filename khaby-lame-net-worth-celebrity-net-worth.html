He is best known for his popularity on TikTok where he has over 140 million fans. For several years, Khaby was the second-most followed person on TikTok, behind <a href=#>Charli D'Amelio</a>. In June of 2022 Khaby's 142.5 million followers surpassed Charli's 142.2 to make him the #1 most-followed person on TikTok. He also has around 80 million followers on Instagram.</p><h2 id=earnings><strong>Earnings</strong></h2><p>In an interview, Lame revealed that he can make up to $750,000 per video clip earning him around $10 million in 2022. He earned $17 million in 2023.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Khabane "Khaby" Lame was born on March 9, 2000 in Senegal. When he was just a baby, the family moved to Italy. They eventually settled in the city of Chivasso where the family lived in a public housing complex.</p><h2 id=tiktok-fame><strong>TikTok Fame</strong></h2><p>Before becoming one of the most famous social media personalities in the world, Khaby was a modest factory worker in Chivasso. He was laid off from his job in March 2020 as COVID-19 shut much of the country's manufacturing down.</p><p>In his free time he began posting regularly to TikTok. He quickly hit on an incredibly simple magic formula: He posted videos that made fun of overly complicated life hack videos that included his now-trademark exasperated sardonic smirk.</p><p>His home-made simple reaction videos made him one of the most famous people on TikTok. As we mentioned earlier, as of this writing he is the most followed person on the platform with over 158.3 million followers, just ahead of Charli D'Amelio.</p><p>With his meteoric fame, Khaby has made millions from sponsorships, appearance fees and merchandise. He estimates he makes around $400,000 per TikTok clip he creates for any given brand.</p><p>His Instagram store currently sells a variety of products including candles, a popcorn machine, clothing and a watermelon cutter.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-324597 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Khaby-Lame-2.jpg alt="Khaby Lame Wealth" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1568px) 100vw, 1568px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-324597 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP via Getty Images)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>According to a <a href=#>New York Times profile</a> due to a quirk in the Italian legal system, Khaby was not actually an Italian citizen despite the fact that he has lived in the country since he was one. Apparently this lack of Italian citizenship has made it difficult to travel at times as Senegalese people can have more difficulty obtaining visas in some countries. But in August 2022, he became an Italian citizen in Chivasso.</p><p>In October 2020 Khaby became engaged to Zaira Nucci.</p><p>Khaby Lame has a voice cameo in the Italian-dubbed version of 2022's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqku8yem6KZnqh8rLTAm7BmpJGism66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
