They dropped a princely $13.45 million on the Beverly Hills mansion, and the story speculates that since they're listed as co-owners they split the cost 50/50.</p><p>As for the mansion itself, it's as you might expect of premium luxury and has plenty of room, reportedly 2,300 square feet for the master bedroom alone. Then there are the amenities that one familiar with the Kardashian standard of living would expect, like a massage room, gym, three-car garage, and more. Realtor Ernie Carswell describes it like this:</p><p><strong>"Architectural compound in coveted lower BHPO [the Beverly Hills Post Office neighborhood] pristinely set behind private gated driveway, offering sparkling city & ocean views. Minimalist lines intersect w/organic textures inspired by lush canyon surroundings, cultivating an immense sense of tranquility. Voluminous double-story foyer opens to meticulously sculpted, grand-scale Living & Dining spaces framed by walls of glass that effortlessly slide away to pool/spa, lounge & BBQ area for open indoor-outdoor living & entertaining."</strong></p><p>While the home is the first shared by Jenner and Scott, it's not the former's first, and is in fact her fifth property following the purchase of her own $12 million home in Hidden Hills about two years ago. If that's not enough information on the Kylie Jenner real estate beat, she's also selling a property, having listed an empty lot also in Hidden Hills back in August of this year, only some ten months after she purchased it for $5 million (she's looking to turn a $500,000 profit by her asking price).</p><p>If you want a closer look at the pair's new Beverly Hills Post Office home, just take check out the real estate listing video below:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGebrrmqsYyjnKemlad6orrDZqurmaaewG6%2FwqirrWWaqsC1ecGorKCgpGLBqbXSZqCnm6Kasaquy55kamtdaYJuucilo6KnnmKvpsLEq6OyZZieua2%2FjKaYp6uZpLtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
