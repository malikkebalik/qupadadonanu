The CEO of BlazeNow, Jeremy Carr, says that the app is set to launch in April. As far as the roles of Method man and Redman? "[Method Man and Redman] have been aware of the development of BlazeNow for a little while and they love the business plan and like the app and want to be involved," said Carr.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-191117 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-91072171.jpg alt="NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 23: Rappers Method Man (L) and Redman perform onstage at the 2009 VH1 Hip Hop Honors at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on September 23, 2009 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.
