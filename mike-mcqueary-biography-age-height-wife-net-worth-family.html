The trial date was set for October 17, 2016, upon which it opened with testimony by a state prosecutor. The university's action, framed both as wrongful dismissal and for damages in defamation (libel and slander), was seen as such by a jury and McQueary was awarded $7.3 million, including compensatory and punitive damages, on October 27, 2016. Penn State filed an appeal on November 7, 2016, and on November 30, another almost $5 million was ordered payable to McQueary based on a separate charge that his firing was retaliation for whistleblowing. Penn State appealed the verdicts, and McQueary ended his lawsuit in November 2017, after reaching undisclosed settlement terms with the university.</p><p>As of March 2014, he was separated from his wife Barbara, who was living in Virginia with their daughter, then 4 years old. McQueary has an older brother, John II. Their father, physician John Sr, has described theirs as "an unusually close family", having been close before the sex abuse scandal and more so after it became so well known.</p><p>On November 11, 2011, Penn State announced McQueary would not be serving as receivers coach in the final home game of the season due to threats against him, and put him on indefinite paid administrative leave. Later that day, The Patriot-News reported that McQueary told his receivers in a conference call that he would no longer be their coach.</p><p>McQueary returned to Penn State in 2000 following attempts to catch on in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders and in NFL Europe with the Scottish Claymores. His roles on the football coaching staff included graduate assistant coach (2000–2002), administrative assistant (2003), and recruiting coordinator and receivers coach (2004–2011). As recruiting coordinator, McQueary oversaw the recruitment of several high-profile recruits including <a href=#>Justin King</a>, <a href=#>Derrick Williams</a> and <a href=#>Andrew Quarless</a>.</p><p>After a high school career at State College Area High School, McQueary was a quarterback for Penn State from 1994 through 1997. He backed up <a href=#>Kerry Collins</a> in 1994, and backed up <a href=#>Wally Richardson</a> in 1995 and 1996. He started all 12 games as a senior in 1997, leading Penn State to a 9–3 record and a Citrus Bowl bid. In his first college start against Pittsburgh (on September 6), McQueary passed for a then-Penn State record 366 yards in a 34–17 victory over the Panthers. For the season, he completed 146 of 255 passes for 2211 yards and 17 touchdowns (both yards and touchdowns second in the Big Ten to Purdue's Billy Dicken), while tossing 9 interceptions.</p><p><a href=#>Michael Jacob</a> McQueary (born October 10, 1974) is a former American football assistant coach for the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) under head coach <a href=#>Joe Paterno</a> until late in the 2011 football season. McQueary was identified as a key witness in the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVforassYymmqqtlZa%2Fug%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
