Pat Sajak is most famous for being the long term host of the game show "Wheel of Fortune." He has hosted the show since 1981. For his work on "Wheel" Pat earns an annual salary of $15 million. <a href=#>Vanna White's salary is $3 million</a>. As we explain later in this article, <a href=#>Pat and Vanna also make a ton of money every year licensing their image to casino slot machines</a>. For Vanna, she actually makes more from Casino licensing than the her Wheel of Fortune salary. On June 12, 2023 Pat and Sony, the company that owns "Wheel of Fortune," announced that he would retire from the show in 2024. On June 26, 2023, <a href=# title="Ryan Seacrest Net Worth">Ryan Seacrest</a> announced he had agreed to take over Pat's hosting duties after the 41st season.</p><p>Pat's first foray into media happened when he was attending Columbia College in Chicago in the 1960s, where he was chosen to be a news anchor on the local radio station, WEDC. He joined the Army in 1968 during the Vietnam War, and was a deejay on Armed Forces Radio. When he returned from Vietnam, he continued dj-ing for stations in Kentucky, and Nashville (WSM). It was at WSM's sister station, WSN-TV, where he had his first on-screen opportunity. At WSN-TV, Sajak first served as a voiceover artist doing station identifications, then anchoring five minute newscasts during NBC's Today Show, then serving as a weekend and substitute weatherman. In 1977, Sajak accepted an opportunity to work at Los Angeles's KNBC-TV as a full time weatherman.</p><p>In 1981, <a href=#>Merv Griffin</a>, the creator of "Wheel of Fortune" and countless other game shows, asked Sajak if he would like to take over the show's hosting duties from <a href=#>Chuck Woolery</a>, who was the original host. Fred Silverman, then the CEO of NBC, rejected the idea. Merv Griffin threatened to cease all new tapings until Sajak was hired. Sajak was eventually hired in 1981 and has hosted the show ever since. <a href=# title="Susan Stafford Net Worth">Susan Stafford</a> was his hostess until 1982 when Vanna White took over.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-218884 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pat.jpg alt width=900 height=596 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-218884 class=wp-caption-text>Greg Fiume/Getty Images</p><h2 id=pat-sajak-salary><strong>Pat Sajak Salary</strong></h2><p>As of this writing, Pat Sajak earns an annual salary of $14 million as host of Wheel of Fortune. For comparison, Vanna White's salary is $10 million. Wheel of Fortune tapes four days per month, six shows per day. They tape two Thursdays and two Fridays. On taping days, they both arrive around 8:30 am and start shooting at noon. One audience watches three shows, then there is a break for lunch. A second audience comes in to watch three more tapings.</p><p>Pat and Vanna tape four days per month. That's 48 days per year of work to earn $14 and $10 million per year, respectively. That means Vanna earns $208,333 per workday. Pat earns $312,500 per workday. Breaking it down per show, Pat Sajak earns $52,083 per show and Vanna White earns $34,722 per show.</p><h2 id=casino-licensing-earnings><strong>Casino Licensing Earnings</strong></h2><p>Believe it or note, Pat Sajak and Vanna White's salaries from "Wheel of Fortune" aren't their largest source of annual income. Both Pat and Vanna make more money licensing their images to casino slot machines than they do from the game show itself.</p><p>Wheel of Fortune was actually the FIRST entertainment property to be licensed for use on slot machines. In 1996 the first Wheel of Fortune branded slot machines were placed in casinos in Las Vegas. They quickly proved to be extremely successful and were licensed to casinos around the world. Within a decade, the Wheel of Fortune branded slot machines were reported to be the highest revenue generating slot machines in most casinos. There are an estimated 20,000 "Wheel" slot machines on casinos floors around the world. In Las Vegas alone, Wheel of Fortune slot machines generate over $1 billion per year in gross revenue. Worldwide the machines generate over $2 billion.</p><p>In exchange for licensing their respective images and likenesses for the slot machines, Pat and Vanna both earn at least $15 million per year in royalties, licensing fees and other payments.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Pat Sajak was born Patrick Leonard Sajdak October 26, 1946 in Chicago, Illinois.

He applied and ended up landing the station's 6 a.m. time slot. Sajak joined the U.S. Army in 1968 during the Vietnam war. While serving in the Army he deejayed on Armed Forces Radio. While DJing, he began each broadcast with the line "Good morning, Vietnam!" just like <a href=# title="Robin Williams Net Worth">Robin Williams</a>' character did in the movie of the same name. In the early '70s, Sajak DJ'd in Nashville in the 3:00-5:00 p.m. time slot as their afternoon personality</p><p>In the late 1970s Sajak moved to Los Angeles seeking work in the entertainment industry.
