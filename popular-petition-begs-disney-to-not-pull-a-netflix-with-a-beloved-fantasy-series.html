Although only a few thousand have signed so far, it seems the petition makers are hopeful that once they hit 5,000 signatures, they’ll be able to get Disney’s attention. The person who started this petition, Aubrey Smalls, has this to say on the Change.org page:</p><p>“On May 26, Disney+ will be removing the only series on its service featuring a character with dwarfism. Today, we are urging Disney to re-evaluate this decision in support of creatives with disabilities. Please sign this petition if you support Disney+ keeping the Willow series on their service.”</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Willow is a sequel to the 1988 film of the same name, and stars Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood, a Nelwyn sorcerer who leads a small party in an attempt to rescue a kidnapped royal. Davis played the role in the original movie too.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I've been quiet on this news that <a href=#>#Willow</a> is leaving <a href=#>@DisneyPlus</a> 'cause… I'm kinda into it. I grew up at a time when <a href=#>@Disney</a> movies were periodically re-released and not available to own, and it made them… more special. I worry about many things…</p>— Jon Kasdan (@JonKasdan) <a href=#>May 22, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Although it is always a bit confusing trying to figure out how and why executives decide to cut certain shows, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Willow it’s particularly infuriating</a>. The series did well in terms of viewing figures, and has had a great critical reception, earning praise for its set dressing, acting performances, and engaging storylines.</p><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=872 data-injectable=true>Aside from the petition, there’s been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty of other social media activity in support of the show</a>. There’s also a very <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">popular hashtag on TikTok</a> begging Disney to save the series. Advocates not only want to see it preserved because they’re fans of the world, but also because of the fact it’s one of the few shows on a streaming network that stars a performer with dwarfism, and that it also has plenty of other great cast members who represent facets on various communities that are often underrepresented in media.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Reasons why removing Willow from Disney is a bad idea:<br>Is the literal erasure of LGBTQIA+ representation, mainly Lesbian representation, you can count in your hands how many fantasy shows or movies exist with lesbians main characters, and this passes a very bad message to <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4VFoUCdmzx</a></p>— Bea Cruz HATES Disney (@themeanlesbian) <a href=#>May 21, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=false>For now, though, it seems that Disney is set to follow through with its plans to axe the series and remove it from their platform, even though it’s only been on there for less than a year. Whether or not the fans can make a difference depends on all manner of things, but if the past is anything to go by, it seems Willow is in jeopardy of disappearing for good.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxu8%2Buo5qqXaWytbXToqanZZKatLR5w6Kqp52pYsGwec2oq2aopaG5bq2Mp5ytnpyexW7DyK2fZpldl7Ktu9Wem2aekaPBor%2FYZqqeqpmawHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
