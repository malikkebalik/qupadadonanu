He made his announcement with an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> video. The video started with a photo of him on The Voice, with texts overlaid over the image questioning when he would return. The image then switches to a video of Levine stating he’s officially returning to the series.</p><p id=par-3_23>“Team Adam is back,” he tells the camera. “I feel bad for other teams. Let’s go. I’m well rested. I’m ready to go.”</p><p id=par-4_52>Doug Eldridge of Achilles PR&nbsp;spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News Digital</a> about Levine’s decision to return. “It’s the ‘Ozempic of exposure,'” he said. “You get the benefits of constant touring and appearances needed to sustain your popularity and musical career without actually having to do the hard work traditionally required to attain those goals.”</p><p id=par-5_68>Eldridge added that being a musician on a reality series is an “effort-free” exposure. “If you’re a big-name act who wants to stay in the national eye, but you need a break from the grind of touring, producing new music, hitting the media circuit, etc., then what better way to do that than a relatively effort-free platform like [America’s Got Talent] or [American Idol]?” the expert continued.</p><p id=par-6_48>Levine’s “likeability” on The Voice may also boost his music career. “If the artist-host can win the audience through likability, then they’ll boost their album sales (or downloads, as it were) without having to step foot in the studio or get anywhere near a tour bus,” he continued.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-maroon-5-frontman-was-allegedly-very-difficult-during-taping>The Maroon 5 frontman was allegedly ‘very difficult’ during taping</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Adam-Levine-The-Voice-1.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-7_28>Adam Levine explained that he left The Voice to spend time with his family and move on to other projects. However, there’s likely more to the story.</p><p id=par-8_53><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> reports that a source told TVLine that Levine was “very difficult” to work with during season 16. Levine had no singers on his team heading into the semifinals, but NBC wanted him present for the taping. The Maroon 5 frontman expressed frustration at being there without being able to compete.</p><p id=par-9_39>Paul Telegdy, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, was particularly upset when Levine appeared lifeless during a performance for the annual Upfront showcase of returning and new series. The co-chairman was reportedly “embarrassed” and “furious” at Levine’s lethargic stage presence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-coach-gwen-stefani-allegedly-has-personal-feelings-against-adam-levine>‘The Voice’ coach Gwen Stefani allegedly has ‘personal’ feelings against Adam Levine</h2><p id=par-10_68>Gwen Stefani, Reba McEntire, Michael Bublé, and Snoop Dogg are returning to The Voice as coaches for season 26. Stefani reportedly has “personal feelings” against Adam Levine. In 2022, Levine was caught in a cheating scandal where Instagram model Sumner Stroh posted inappropriate text messages that he sent her while married to Behati Prinsloo. Levine apologized for crossing a line, but he maintains he never had an affair.</p><p id=par-11_46>A source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OK! Magazine</a> that Stefani wanted her and Blake Shelton to <a href=#>keep their distance from Levine</a> in the wake of the scandal. “For her, it’s personal,” the source alleged. “She isn’t worried about Adam being a bad influence [on Blake]; this is about principle.”</p><p id=par-12_13>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, follow&nbsp;<a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9s3nEsaeeqqRiwKLF0maYnZmdYrmmwsinnGaqlZ%2B8qrrIp55mrJiaere7yJycZpmmpLaleceaqZ1lp6S%2FrHnNnpqeq6OWv7p50q2YsmWimrmmwsCnq2egpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
