He looked tan, fit, happy, rich and content. You know that makes so many people feel sick! Speaking of, the Sussexes’ spokesperson confirmed that Harry will not see his father during his UK trip this week. Apparently, Harry was told that his father is much too busy to see him.</p><p>Prince Harry will not meet with his father King Charles during his trip to the U.K., PEOPLE confirms.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex, 39, says, “In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty’s full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father’s diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.”</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>I’m sorry but this is so funny. The Windsors – minus Anne – have been doing f–k all for months. Charles made all of two public appearances last week. William went to a football match on his daughter’s birthday. But as soon as Harry confirmed his visit, they’ve been rushing around, furiously scheduling busy-work events so that Harry will think that they’re very, very busy, too busy to meet him. I’m pretty sure the big event on Charles’s schedule TOMORROW is a garden party. That’s it. Plus, the palace has been trying to play this stupid game in the media, a game of “maybe if Harry begs, Charles will find 20 minutes in his busy schedule to see him.” Harry just kneecapped that whole storyline.</p><p>Photos of Harry in London today:</p><p><a id=S3aXF-luSiVGnuO-hBp5ZA class=gie-single href=# rel=noopener>Embed from Getty Images</a></p><p><a id=Wv_PO-ryQOx0BAfPE2POUQ class=gie-single href=# rel=noopener>Embed from Getty Images</a></p><p><a id=BSwkrBl6Ru5592cNTdvmXQ class=gie-single href=# rel=noopener>Embed from Getty Images</a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Getty, Avalon Red, Cover Images.<br></p><a href=#><img width=150 height=110 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/avalon-0774201323-1-150x110.jpg alt aria-describedby=gallery-1-870720 sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Prince Harry leaves Westminster Abbey after the Coronation of King Charles III in London, United Kingdom, on 06 May 2023.,Image: 774201323, License: Rights-managed, Restrictions: -, Model Release: no, Credit line: Unknown / Avalon <a href=#><img width=150 height=109 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/avalon-0774227942-150x109.jpg alt aria-describedby=gallery-1-870721 sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Prince Harry departs The Coronation Service of King Charles III at Westminster Abbey in London, England, UK on Saturday 6 May, 2023.,Image: 774227942, License: Rights-managed, Restrictions: Please credit photographer and agency when publishing as Justin Ng/UPPA/Avalon., Model Release: no, Credit line: Justin Ng / Avalon <a href=#><img width=114 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/avalon-0774252232-114x150.jpg alt aria-describedby=gallery-1-870722 sizes="(max-width: 114px) 100vw, 114px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Prince Harry Duke of Sussex at The Coronation of King Charles III at London”s Westminster Abbey 06 May 2023,Image: 774252232, License: Rights-managed, Restrictions: -, Model Release: no, Credit line: Mark Stewart / Avalon<br><a href=#><img width=132 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/coverimages52687919-1-132x150.jpg alt aria-describedby=gallery-1-870723 sizes="(max-width: 132px) 100vw, 132px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> The Duke of Sussex arriving arriving ahead of the coronation ceremony of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey, central London.
