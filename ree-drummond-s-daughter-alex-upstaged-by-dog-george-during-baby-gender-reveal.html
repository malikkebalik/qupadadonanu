The couple married in May 2021 on the Drummond ranch.</p><p id=par-3_39>Therefore, with great excitement, the couple shared the news on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, that they were welcoming a baby alongside their beloved golden retriever, George. He was a key part of the announcement, wearing a neck scarf that said “big brother.”</p><p id=par-4_32>On June 30, Alex and Mauricio shared a video in which they revealed their baby’s gender. Again, George was the star of the show, but his eagerness upstaged the big moment.</p><p id=par-5_38>Alex and Mauricio used cupcakes to reveal if they were having a boy or a girl. George’s role was to bite into the sweet treat so the couple could show the camera the color of the creamy interior.</p><p id=par-6_31>However, George had other ideas. He bit off so much of the first cupcake that he ate the entire middle, and the couple had to begin again with a second one.</p><p id=par-7_28>Finally, after a second go-around, Alex and Mauricio revealed they would welcome a baby girl in the first days of 2025. The couple couldn’t contain their excitement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-s-sweet-vow-upon-learning-she-would-have-a-granddaughter>‘The Pioneer Woman’: Ree Drummond’s sweet vow upon learning she would have a granddaughter</h2><p id=par-8_40>In the caption of the Instagram video, Ree Drummond shared her thoughts about the video and news she would welcome her first grandchild, a granddaughter, to the Drummond family.

The Food Network personality said this surprise came at an extraordinary time.</p><p id=par-14_60>“Gosh, it feels totally different than I thought it would feel,” she explains. “Since we just kind of <a href=#>became empty-nesters</a>, <a href=#>Ladd [Drummond] and I</a> feel like we just finished raising our kids — not even finished! A couple of them are in college, so we’re still raising our kids.” The <a href=#>couple are parents</a> to Alex, Paige, Bryce, Todd, and Jamar.</p><p id=par-15_62>She continued, “We weren’t necessarily in a big rush to enter the grandparent stage. I thought when I heard the news eventually, whenever that would be, that I would feel more, ‘Oh no, here it comes.’ But instead, what I think about most is — this is my honest answer — just how happy I am for my daughter and her husband.”</p><p id=par-16_56>Ree concluded, “Thinking back on the days when my kids were babies and those years, I mean, I can hardly look at old pictures because it was just such a precious, fun time. I’m just so happy that she is going to enter into that period of her life. There’s just nothing better in the world.”</p><p id=par-17_14>Ree Drummond stars in The Pioneer Woman.
