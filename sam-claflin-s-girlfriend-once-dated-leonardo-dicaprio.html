She told the publication that she is passionate about her health and finds that working out and doing Pilates were great ways of staying in peak health, both mentally and physically. “Nothing feels better than all those happy juices that are released when I work out, so that’s really the inspo. The change you feel inside,” she said.</p><p id=par-6_36>Amato has been linked to some high-profile names before. The model <a href=#>briefly dated Leonardo DiCaprio</a> in 2015 when she was 21.
