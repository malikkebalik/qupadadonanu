Spike Jonze has a net worth of $50 million. Jonze accumulated his fortune through directing, producing, and acting in films, television shows, commercials, and music videos as well as being a co-founder of Directors Labels. Making his start as a photographer for skateboarder magazine "Freestylin'" in the late 1980s, Spike turned to making films and music videos in the '90s. Soon he earned nods from critics and audiences for his popular takes on the Beastie Boy's "Sabotage" (1994) and Weezer's "<a href=# title="Buddy Holly Net Worth">Buddy Holly</a>" (1994), which skillfully incorporated a "Happy Days" theme and actual show footage. While he became firmly grounded in the music video world, Jonze decided to dip his toes into something bigger and more complex, such as feature films.</p><p>Breaking the ice as an actor in "The Game" (1997) and "Three Kings" (1999), he went on to establish himself as a director with the strikingly original "Being <a href=# title="John Malkovich Net Worth">John Malkovich</a>" (1999), which fetched him an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Next, he trod into uncharted territory as one of the creators of the outrageous MTV series "Jackass" (2000â€“2002), which earned public condemnation for its depiction of dangerous, but hilarious stunts. Getting back to narrative film-making, Spike directed "Adaptation." (2002), a wildly unique, offbeat, and entertaining dramedy that confirmed him as a filmmaker who knows how to surprise his audiences with innovative techniques and insightful ideas. Jonze then directed 2009's"Where the Wild Things Are," followed by the Academy Award-winning "Her" in 2013.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Spike Jonze was born Adam Spiegel on October 22, 1969, in New York City. His parents, Sandra L. Granzow and Arthur H. Spiegel III, divorced when Spike was young, and Jonze and his siblings, Sam and Julia, grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, with their mother. Arthur founded a healthcare consulting firm, and Sandra had a career in public relations. Spike's great-great-grandfather was Joseph Spiegel, who launched the Spiegel catalog. Jonze attended Walt Whitman High School and took a job at the Rockville BMX store when he was 16. His co-workers gave him the nickname "Spike Jonze" because he would "come to work without showering, and his hair was usually sticking straight up." While photographing BMX expos, Spike befriended Mark Lewman and Andy Jenkins, the editors of "Freestylin'" magazine, who offered him a job while he was still in high school. Jonze moved to California the day after he finished his finals. He formed an international BMX club, Club Homeboy, with Lewman and Jenkins, and they created the magazines "Dirt" and "Homeboy."</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After working as a photographer for several BMX and skateboarding publications, Jonze began making skateboarding videos, one of which made its way to <a href=# title="Kim Gordon Net Worth">Kim Gordon</a> of Sonic Youth.
