I know that from the comments on this site and others. I know that there was a comment war on Friday when CB talked about how she felt about Oksana’s injuries and Mel’s campaign against her. Here’s what I told CB: Oksana has smart lawyers, and she has good people around her. Don’t count her out, and whenever you worry about Mel coming out ahead, really think about how smartly Oksana has played this so far. At this point, she’s not going down without a fight.</p><p>First: People Magazine got a strategic interview from Oksana, all about her relationship to her ex Timothy Dalton, father of her son Alexander (who may have witnesses Mel Gibson abusing his mom, and <a href=#>who spoke to Child Services this weekend</a>). My guess is that Timothy Dalton will probably be making some kind of statement on Oksana’s behalf shortly:</p><p>As Oksana Grigorieva’s custody battle with Mel Gibson gets progressively nastier, she has turned to another ex for support: Former James Bond actor Timothy Dalton.</p><p>“He’s very good,” Grigorieva tells PEOPLE, of Dalton, 66, who is the father of Grigorieva’s 12-year-old son, Alexander.</p><p>Dalton was seen Friday morning stopping by the Russian singer’s Sherman Oaks residence, which is owned by Mel Gibson.</p><p>“We raise our son together,” Grigorieva said Friday. “He’s a good father and they have a very good relationship.”</p><p>As for how she’s faring in the midst of her public wrangling with Gibson, the 40-year-old mother says she and daughter Lucia, 9 months, are both doing “okay.”</p><p>Grigorieva also insists she didn’t release the explosive alleged taped conversations with Gibson or the photo of herself with broken teeth.</p><p>“I didn’t release anything and I’m not happy with the lies being spread,” she says. “But when the court is done with the investigation, then I’ll be able to talk.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>People</a>]</p><p>Oksana‘s rep also <a href=#>confirmed to Radar</a> that the photo of her bruised face is “a true and accurate photograph.” Her rep even went to TMZ and called what Mel’s camp’s activities a “smear campaign” and that the Mel Camp’s claims that her injuries were self-inflicted are “disgusting”. <a href=#>Stephen Jaffe told TMZ</a>: “While Mr. Gibson’s camp has floated a variety of false claims in the press to try to distract the public from the true facts at hand, it is telling that his camp has not once denied that it is Mr. Gibson’s voice on the published recordings. It is common in such cases for those who perpetrate domestic violence to vilify the victim of that domestic violence. One would hope that those who are close to Mr. Gibson would take a more constructive approach.” And after running several interviews with “experts” who analyzed the photo, many of whom claimed that Oksana somehow injured herself and blamed Mel, <a href=#>TMZ ran this interview with another “expert”</a>: “It is obvious not only from the photograph of Ms. Grigorieva, but from other evidence, including Mr. Gibson’s own admission, that he struck her in the mouth and temple, that she sustained injuries as a result of his blows. The notion that her wounds were ‘self-inflicted’ is ridiculous and not credible. No legitimate, independent expert photo analyst could reasonably draw such a conclusion. Her injuries are consistent with her account.”</p><p>Now, I don’t want to start another war here, I really don’t. I believe Oksana – about 90%. Do I think she might have exaggerated here and there for dramatic affect, or maybe just gotten a few technical details wrong? Sure. But I think the bulk of what she’s said is true, and I think there’s enough evidence to support the idea that Mel Gibson is an insane, vile, disgusting, physically, verbally and emotionally abusive man. If his private actions were disgusting enough, he and his team have begun to wage this ridiculous campaign against Oksana in which they’re trying to make Mel into the victim – that alone shows how f-cked up Mel’s mental state is. My opinion.</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Oh, and the latest news: Mel Gibson is putting his <a href=#>Malibu properties for sale</a>, and word is he wants to go live in Australia (to scream at and beat Aussie women, I presume).</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/view2.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/7800228/photocall-edge-darkness/photocall-edge-darkness.jpg border=0 width=500 title="Photocall of 'Edge of Darkness' - Paris" height=753 oncontextmenu=return!1 ondrag=return!1 onmousedown=return!1 alt="Mel Gibson posing for the Photocall of ' Edge of Darkness ' at the Bristol Hotel in Paris, France February 4, 2010.
