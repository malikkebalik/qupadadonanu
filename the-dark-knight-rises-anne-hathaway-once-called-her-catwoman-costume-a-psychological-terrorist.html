Instead, <a href=#>The Princess Diaries star</a> thought Nolan was going to have her play another DC villain. And so she dressed accordingly.</p><p id=par-3_55>“That was the initial meet with Chris,” Hathaway told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC Radio 1</a>. “I came in and I had this lovely Vivian Westwood kind of beautiful but mad tailoring top with stripes going everywhere, and I wore these flat kind of Jokery looking shoes. And I was just trying to give Chris these crazy little smiles.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_11>Eventually, Nolan informed Hathaway that she was actually auditioning for Catwoman.</p><p id=par-5_32>“And then about an hour into it, he goes, ‘I’m sure that I don’t have to tell you this, but it’s Catwoman.’ I was like, ‘Shifting into a different gear right now.’”</p><p id=par-6_19>Still, even after rehearsing for the right character, it turned out to be a long auditioning process for Hathaway.</p><p id=par-7_49>“I kind of thought the auditions would be a few weeks later, but it was months,” Hathaway said. “And I knew I was gonna be brought in to do the final audition, so then it was nice because then I was like, ‘Ok, now I know who this is.’”</p><h2 id=h-anne-hathaway-called-her-catwoman-costume-a-psychological-terror>Anne Hathaway called her Catwoman costume a ‘psychological terror’</h2><p id=par-8_39>Hathaway not only had to be able to do the part, but look it as well when she acquired the role. This meant she had to obtain the right physique to be able to fill in <a href=#>the Catwoman costume</a>.</p><p id=par-9_33>“The Catwoman suit, it was a psychological terrorist,” Hathaway told Allure (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Comicbook Movie</a>.) “The suit, thoughts of my suit, changing my life so I would fit into that suit…it dominated my year.”</p><p id=par-10_20>To achieve the necessary physique for Rises and Les Miserables, Hathaway went on a diet that had unexpected side effects.</p><p id=par-11_36>“I’m on day six of detox … this diet makes me break out, so I love that,” she added. “Nothing like living on hummus and radishes and then be all, ‘And I got a pimple.

She detailed what she both loved and hated about being Catwoman in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MTV News</a>.</p><p id=par-13_59>“The best? I’m in Batman,” Hathaway said. “That was the best. The worst, it doesn’t matter; I’m in Batman. Like, this is not the sort of job where you nitpick or find things to complain about. I was as happy as I’ve been on anything on this one, it was ‘Count your lucky stars every single day.,’” she confided.</p><p id=par-14_23>The Oscar-winner also gave some advice to any future actors that might’ve found themselves in Hathaway’s position of adapting a comic book character.</p><p id=par-15_60>“Work with people you trust and they’ll take care of you, don’t try to please anyone with it,” she said. “Because I think if I had been forced to fit a certain ideal I wouldn’t have been able to do it. But everyone’s attitude was, ‘Become the character physically,’ and then that’s the way the suit is meant to look.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxor7KZqKnoZedwW6%2ByKycrGWRo7umeceaq6GZp5bGbq%2FApaOenF2YrrXDzqaYp2WTpMC1wcyeZKmrqZi1sLjOoKCcmZxiwaa%2B0aipoqukY7W1ucto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
