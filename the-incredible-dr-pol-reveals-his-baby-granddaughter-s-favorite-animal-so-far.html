It is the family business, after all!

The couple was wed in 2018.</p><p id=par-5_18>Dr. Pol tweeted&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a welcoming message</a>&nbsp;to his new granddaughter, “Welcome to the world, Abigail Pol! Congratulations Charles & Beth!”</p><p id=par-6_45>Charles is responsible for encouraging his father to be the subject of a reality show. As the doctor explained to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Parade</a>&nbsp;in 2018, “Charles was in L.A. for eight years, and he and a couple of friends wanted to get into producing reality shows. That never happened.”</p><p id=par-7_35>“So Charles tells them, ‘We should go to my dad. He’s a large-animal veterinarian and he’s a character.’ Charles was working at Nickelodeon with computers, so he had a job, but not what he wanted.”</p><h2>Every cat owner will agree with Dr. Pol’s assessment of felines</h2><p id=par-8_28>Each week after every new episode of The Incredible Dr. Pol, there’s a new after-show filled with fun content on YouTube Live called Dr. Pol Presents Recheck.</p><p id=par-9_80>On the August 8 episode of Recheck, Dr. Pol and his son, Charles, got around to the subject of cats. The vet admitted that cats can be some of the most difficult animals to treat because as he said, “cats are very stoic. Yes, you can own a cat, but most of the time, the cat owns you. And you take care of it…it’s a little princess and it gets what it wants, when it wants, and how it wants.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_27>“But when they’re sick,” Dr. Pol continued, “they try to hide things. So people don’t know right away that a cat is sick until it’s too late…”</p><p id=par-11_21>Charles reminded his father of the numerous times the older Pol has told him how hard it is to “read” cats.</p><p id=par-12_38>“That’s exactly right,” Dr. Pol confirmed. “I look animals in the eyes, and most of the time, you can tell what these animals are thinking – except cats. Their look back at you says, ‘What do you want?'”</p><h2>Baby Abigail just might be a cat person</h2><p id=par-13_10>Charles Pol dropped a big surprise on his dog-loving dad.</p><p id=par-14_34>“I think that there are definitely cat people in the world, and dog people in the world,” Charles began. “You know, I love my cats, but I’d have to say I’m a dog person.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p>Abigail and her friends!</figure><p id=par-15_17>He continued, “I have a surprise for you. I think baby Abigail might be a cat person.”</p><p id=par-16_6>Dr. Pol’s eyebrows shot up.</p><p id=par-17_29>Charles rolled the video showing little Abigail with a Great Dane, a gray cat, and even a goat. Abigail definitely does a lot more squealing around her feline friend.</p><p id=par-18_16>But see if you agree with her father’s guess, starting at 2:38 in the video above.</p><p id=par-19_11><strong>RELATED</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>‘The Incredible Dr. Pol’: His Surprisingly Simple Advice for Aspiring Veterinarians</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMoqWcqpWZtqO4xGabq2WgpLluvsSvnJqko2K1qr%2BMm5ibsV2cv6K6w52Yrp%2BYqbKzv4yfmK%2Bnop7BpnnAp6CmmZxiwLB5xZqpZ6Ckorlw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
