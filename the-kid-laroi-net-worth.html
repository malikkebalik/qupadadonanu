His father is Nick, an accomplished music producer and sound engineer, while his mother is Sloane, a former talent manager, music executive, and record label founder of Aboriginal ancestry. Through his great-great grandfather, who was part of the "Stolen Generation," Howard is of Indigenous Australian Kamilaroi descent; he adopted the stage name "Laroi" based on the Kamilaroi people. When he was four, his parents divorced. He subsequently moved to the rural town of Broken Hill, New South Wales with his mother, brother, and grandparents. There, he went to Sacred Hart Parish School. Later, Howard briefly attended a boarding school in Adelaide. The family then moved to Sydney, where Howard went to the prestigious private school Australian Performing Arts Grammar School. He eventually dropped out, however, to pursue a career in music.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Howard began his music career recording raps on his mom's phone and uploading them to SoundCloud.
