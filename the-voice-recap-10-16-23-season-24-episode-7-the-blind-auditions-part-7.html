Everyone was putting the finishing touches to their respective teams before they headed into the Battles. Reba had only one spot left on her team. The others at least were at threes and twos. But no one wanted to turn tonight for anyone that wasn’t exceptional. The bar was the highest it’s ever been and there were some that were bound to be disappointed. Up first was Huntley. He was the father of two kids. He shares custody with his ex. He was a good dad. He had wanted to be a better father than his was to him and that’s why he auditioned tonight.</p><p>Huntley wanted to better provide for his family one day. He also had a dream. A dream he shared with his children and one he wanted to show them was worth pursuing. Huntley even auditioned this year because his daughter was a huge fan of Reba’s. The little girl was hoping to meet Reba one day. Her dream came true tonight just like her daddy’s. Huntley received a rare four chair turn because his raspy voice was unique in this competition. He could go into any genre with such a voice. And so the judges all did their best to win him over.</p><p>They all enjoyed his performance. They turned at the very beginning and so they actually got to see his stage presence. He’s comfortable onstage. He sings everything. He could go in so many directions that he let his daughter decide who his coach was going to be. And while little Stella loves Reba, she couldn’t help falling for Niall’s charm. His accent and the fact that he put her father at ease had helped seal the decision. Huntley joined Niall’s team. Niall now has only two spots remaining on his team.</p><p>Next up was Azan. Azan was from Texas. She grew up loving to perform. If it wasn’t music, it was ballet or jazz. Azan loved being onstage. She was a part of two bands back home when she wasn’t being a quality control specialist. She said her desk job allows her to keep paying for her mics. Azan auditioned with the song “Golden” tonight. She impressed John with her song selection. She also impressed Reba right away with her tone. Reba was the first to turn only she feared she had no chance up against John. And she was proven right when John quickly won Azan for his team.</p><p>John was then left with one last spot to fill. Eli Ward was next. He had to choose between pursuing his dream or going to college. He chose music. He was a singer/songwriter. He got his writing skills from his dad. He got his love of music from his mom. Both parents supported him in his dream. They were there on the sidelines as he auditioned with the song “Bruises” tonight. He had a relaxed tone that quickly won over both Reba as well as Gwen. Gwen was the first to turn. The ladies enjoyed his energy.</p><p>Gwen also believed she could coach him into tackling his performances a little better. His nerves might have gotten the best of him tonight. Gwen told him that was okay because he had raw talent and she could work with that. Eli chose Team Gwen. Gwen met his parents and she put them at ease. Next up was Bailey Lenderman. She went a different route. She went to college and then right after that she moved to Nashville to pursue Country music. But sadly labels didn’t want to sign her because she wasn’t skinny.</p><p>They all told her to love some weight before auditioning again. They tore at her confidence. She started missing words onstage. She couldn’t perform anymore and so tonight was the first time in a long time she put herself out there. She auditioned with the song “If It Makes You Happy”. She stumbled a little through her performance. It wasn’t perfect. It just had a lot of potential. Something that Niall and Gwen both turned for. And so Bailey went with Niall because she said her husband’s presence would make it easier not to fall for Niall’s beauty.</p><p>Niall, with just one spot remaining, had said he would be a lot pickier going forward. Next up was Colby Cobb. His first dream was to be a doctor and, while he now wishes to pursue his music, it is with the same intent that he wants to reach people. He wants to help them. He wants make people happy again. He chose the song “Somebody Else” for his audition tonight. It was a good song. He sounded good. He just didn’t reach exceptional tonight. The judges didn’t turn for him and he was told to try again next year.</p><p>Next up was Dylan Carter. He was from a small town named Saint George in South Carolina. He has a Southern twang and he auditioned with the song “I Look To You”. It was his mother’s favorite song. She used to ask him to sing it at her funeral whenever she heard it on the radio and eventually that’s what Dylan ended up doing. It’s been a while now since she suddenly passed away. Dylan hasn’t sung the song since his mother’s funeral. He wasn’t too sure about auditioning with it, but he said singing it would be like his mother was there in the room with him.</p><p>Dylan has an impressive voice. Only it was the emotion behind the words that won over the judges. All four judges turned on that first high note. It was so moving that it left Reba in tears and then the others started to tear up after hearing about Dylan’s late mom. Dylan was left with a tough choice about which coach he wanted. He ultimately chose to go with Reba because she understood that he was living out his mother’s dream in honor of her. And now Reba’s team is complete. She knows who she’s going into the Battles with.</p><p>Claire Heilig was next. She was auditioning in part because her son talked her into it. Singing has always been a dream of hers and she put it to the side after her son came along. Then that little boy grew up. He fell in love with music just as much as she did and he told his mom to go after her dream. He was a very wise little boy. He was adorable. Claire loved him to pieces. She was a Country/Indie singer. She missed out on Reba only she won Gwen. Gwen was the only one to turn for her and so it was Gwen’s team she ended up joining.</p><p>Gwen had actually lost count of her team by that point. She thought her team was full with Claire and it turns out she still had one more spot open. Next up was Lennon Vanderdoes. He auditioned with “The Night We Met”. He won a three chair turn with that performance. Reba couldn’t turn for him because her team was full. The other threes turned for him. Lennon quit his job working with the elderly to pursue music full-time a year ago. He literally quit his job with just fifty cents in his pocket. And it paid off because now he was the last member of Niall’s team.</p><p>Both Niall and Reba were now out of the running. John and Gwen equally had one spot left on their teams. Taylor Deneen went next. She auditioned with the song “Redone”. She has such a soulful tone that blew away everyone. Not just Gwen and John. They turned for her of course. They were the only ones that could turn for her and still the other two judges sang her praises. They all would have liked to have Taylor on their team. And three of them were jealousy missing out after she joined Team John.</p><p>John’s team is full. Gwen was the only one that had a spot open. But who was going to win that last spot? The literal last spot? Katie Wheatley auditioned next. She loves music and she wasn’t putting it to the side even as she was very much pregnant. She was probably the first contestant to ever audition in their second trimester. She auditioned with the song “The Middle”. She was shaky. She simply wasn’t what Gwen was looking for and so Gwen didn’t turn for her. And everyone said she could come back next year and even bring the baby.</p><p>And the last contestant of the night was Calla Prejean. She pressed forgo on the whole school thing in order to go straight to working in the industry. She sings at whatever gigs she can find and she works a bunch of odd jobs to keep her afloat. Calla auditioned with the song “You’re So Vain”. It was a bold choice. It earned her points with Gwen and Gwen quickly turned for her. Gwen’s team was now complete with Calla and so everyone was ready for the next round.</p><p>Onto the Battles!</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybsLOopqeZaKasKK8jGpnZmlmYn90edKemKynnmJ%2FdXnEqaCsp5Saenh506GcZpqcnrulecCum6KsmaS7tHnPmqmtZWdk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
