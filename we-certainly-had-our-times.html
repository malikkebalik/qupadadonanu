But in those days, nobody trusted that sort of thing and we just kept thinking, ‘What does she want from us?'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>20 years ago today, Stevie Nicks released Trouble in Shangri-La.<br>With years-long writer's block, she asked Tom Petty to help her write and record.

Despite this, Nicks was a “stoned-gone” fan of the Heartbreakers and wanted Petty to work on her solo album. Through persistence on her part, she formed&nbsp;<a href=#>a lasting friendship with Petty</a>.</p><p id=par-5_20>“She came into my life like a rocket, just refusing to go away,” Petty said in&nbsp;Petty: The Biography&nbsp;by Warren Zanes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>There were rumors that the two dated</h2><p id=par-6_49>Petty and Nicks’ close friendship and collaboration on “Insider” and “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around” led to speculation that they were a couple. They could rely on each other for advice and support. Nicks even abandoned her responsibility to promote her new music to&nbsp;<a href=#>support Petty on tour in Australia</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_28>Petty explained that they could be honest with one another. He once&nbsp;<a href=#>insulted her in a discussion</a>&nbsp;about music, but he was glad they could have those kinds of conversations.</p><p id=par-8_58>“‘You need someone to remind you what you’re capable of,'” he told her. “‘You get too easily distracted by bulls****ers that want to make a hit. I don’t know why you’re doing all this synthesizer rock.’ I was probably an a**hole when I think about it. But I was free enough with her that I could do that.”</p><p id=par-9_28>Zanes pointed out that in the way Petty described Nicks, they sounded like a couple. After hearing this, Petty looked like “a man who can’t argue the point.”</p><p id=par-10_21>“Well, we were close …” Petty responded. “We were never what you’d call ‘an item.’ But we certainly had our times.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rumors about Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks caused problems with his girlfriend</h2><p id=par-11_40>True or not, the rumors that Petty and Nicks were romantically involved caused problems with his future wife, Dana York. When she was coming to visit Petty, she saw a gossip magazine that claimed Petty and Nicks were a couple.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_54>“So Dana thought I was full of s***, just using her while I was dating Stevie Nicks,” he said. “Dana wasn’t from this world of ours. Trying to take someone who’s not from show business and convince them that this bulls*** goes on all the time, that it’s not real? It takes a minute.”</p><p id=par-13_18>The story upset York, but Petty convinced her that it wasn’t true.
