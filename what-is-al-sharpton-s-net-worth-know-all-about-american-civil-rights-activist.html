He attended public schools in Queens and Brooklyn. Whereas Al Sharpton graduated from Samuel J. Tilden High School in 1972. His major interest in politics started when he got enrolled at Brooklyn College, where he opted to major in politics. Moreover, during his schooling, Al Sharpton was involved in civil rights moments, maintained leadership positions, and was a prominent high profile poised to raise the equality between black and white Americans.</p><p>Al Sharpton established his own organization named National Youth Moment when he was dropped out from his college. In this organization, the primary activities carried out were to keep media scrutiny on the racially-based murder case of a black teenager named Micheal Griffith in 1986.</p><p>However, Sharpton polished his speaking style as a child and churchgoer (who ordained a minister at the age of 10). Now, he was known as a Social/political activist and religious leader who was famous enough for raising his voice against racial injustice of Americans of black origin. Al Sharpton’s journey of standing against racial injustice was full of challenges, yet he survived an assassination attempt. Despite hurdles, Sharpton proved to stand sturdy with his motto by organizing more protests and press conferences.</p><p>He participated in elections from different political offices, but he wasn’t famous enough to be elected as an officeholder.</p><p></p><table id=tablepress-485 class="tablepress tablepress-id-485 tablepress-responsive"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class=column-1>Al Sharpton</th><th class=column-2>Wiki/Bio</th></tr><tbody class=row-hover><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1>Birth Name</td><td class=column-2>Alfred Charles Sharpton Jr.</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1>Nick Name</td><td class=column-2>Al Sharpton, Rev</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1>Gender</td><td class=column-2>Male</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd"><td class=column-1>Net Worth</td><td class=column-2>$500 Thousand</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even"><td class=column-1>Birth date</td><td class=column-2>October 3, 1954</td></tr><tr class="row-7 odd"><td class=column-1>Birth place</td><td class=column-2>Brownsville, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr class="row-8 even"><td class=column-1>Height</td><td class=column-2>5 ft 10 in (1.78 m)</td></tr><tr class="row-9 odd"><td class=column-1>Profession</td><td class=column-2>Politician, Actor, Minister, Presenter</td></tr><tr class="row-10 even"><td class=column-1>Education</td><td class=column-2>Samuel J.
