His sudden departure caused many fans to wonder what the future of his career could hold. Judging by his net worth, Black has little to worry about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lucas-black-with-weapon.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lucas Black’s bumpy early career</h2><p id=par-2_73>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Black had no formal training as an actor. He made his debut as an actor in the 1994 film The War alongside Kevin Costner and a young Elijah Wood. Black was 11 years old at the time according to <a href=#>CBS</a>. After that, the actor had roles in a number of minor Hollywood films, including All the Pretty Horses, Flash, Friday Night Lights, and Seven Days in Utopia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lucas-black-with-computer.jpg><p id=par-3_80>Perhaps his most notable role during this period was the time he played Caleb Temple on the series American Gothic. American Gothic was produced by Sam Raimi, the legendary director behind The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Spider-Man. Although the show earned a cult following among fans of horror and fantasy television, American Gothic ran for a single season totaling 22 episodes. The show earned Black a reputation as a talented actor even if it wasn’t a major hit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lucas Black becomes rich through crime shows</h2><p id=par-4_91>Afterwards, Black landed a role in one of the most popular crime series of its day: CSI Miami. He was on the show for two years playing Rick Calucci. He didn’t have a really long stint on the show, but it seemed to pave the way for him to get a role in another popular crime series franchise: NCIS. Specifically, the actor landed a role as Special Agent Christopher LaSalle in the original version of NCIS. He would get to reprise the role in the spin-off series NCIS: New Orleans.</p><p id=par-5_67>The setting of the show is fitting, as Black is from the South, specifically Alabama. He was a series regular for the first six seasons of the show. Fans praised both the character and Black’s performance. Thanks to this role and others, Black has a net worth of $8 million. Sadly, Special Agent LaSalle was recently killed off in a sudden twist, leaving many fans upset.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lucas-black-with-telescope.jpg><p id=par-6_63>As the actor exited the show, he thanked his fans on Twitter, writing “Well. That’s all she wrote for Agent Lasalle, but I wanted to take this time personally to thank all of you fans out there for your love and support. You were there to celebrate the victories and to pick me up when I needed it and I appreciate that.”</p><p id=par-7_82>The actor said he left the show so that he could spend more time with his loved ones. Rumors that Lucas actually left the show so that he could appear in one of the upcoming films in the Fast & Furious franchise. If he is going to appear in the upcoming Fast & Furious movie, his appearance has not yet been officially announced. Regardless of what the future holds for the acclaimed actor, he has certainly become very wealthy through his craft.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7pLXSZq6hmaRitrR5y66amqtdl7mir8qsZKedpGLEsL7ToWWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
