Throughout the entire film, you can tell that every time the Wakanda Forever salute is thrown up, Chadwick Boseman and his character T’Challa was in the back of their minds, honoring both of them in the best way possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnWmqKappSWeqe70Z6tnqqjYrqmrc2ipaBlkaOxbrvRop6ipl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
