According to <a href=#>The New Yorker</a>, Bryant gave himself this name after watching Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill. In the film, the mamba snake referred to deadly assassins.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is mamba mentality?</h2><p id=par-5_10>For Bryant, mamba mentality was about more than just basketball.</p><p id=par-6_58>“Mamba mentality is all about focusing on the process and trusting in the hard work when it matters most,” he told <a href=#>Amazon Book Review</a>.&nbsp;“It’s the ultimate mantra for the competitive spirit.&nbsp; It started just as a hashtag that came to me one day, and it’s grown into something athletes — and even non-athletes — embrace as a mindset.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_49>“Hard work outweighs talent — every time,” he continued.&nbsp;“Mamba mentality is about 4 a.m. workouts, doing more than the next guy and then trusting in the work you’ve put in when it’s time to perform.&nbsp;Without studying, preparation and practice, you’re leaving the outcome to fate. I don’t do fate.”</p><p id=par-8_38>In fact, the mentality became such a phenomenon that Bryant wrote a book about it. In&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Mamba Mentality: How I Play</a>, Bryant talked about the mentality and how he passed it on to other players, like Lebron James.</p><p id=par-9_105>“I always aimed to kill the opposition,”&nbsp;he wrote. “The main thing LeBron and I discussed was what constitutes a killer mentality. He watched how I approached every single practice, and I constantly challenged him and the rest of the guys. I remember there was one half when we were messing around. I came into the locker room at half-time and asked the guys — in a less PG manner — what in the hell we were doing. In the second half, LeBron responded in a big way. He came out with a truly dominant mindset. And I’ve seen him lead that way ever since.”</p><p id=par-10_29>The mamba movement has inspired more than just pro athletes. Fans everywhere are now using the phrase as motivation to keep going, to keep pushing, and to keep fighting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did Kobe Bryant die?</h2><p id=par-11_88>On Sunday, Jan. 26, the world stood still as news of Bryant’s death began hitting the internet.
