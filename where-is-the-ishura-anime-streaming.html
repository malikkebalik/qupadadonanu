Due to the brilliance of the plot, it was soon picked up by ASCII Media Works and started getting published with illustrations by Kureta under their Dengeki no Shin Bungei imprint on Sept. 17, 2019.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>The light novel series then soon sprouted a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">manga</a> adaptation with illustrations by Meguri and began serialization in Kodansha’s Monthly Shōnen Magazine in March 2021. After finding success as a manga, an anime adaptation was inevitably next in line. The anime adaptation of Ishura was first announced on Feb. 12, 2023, and finally premiered a year later on Jan. 3, 2024.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is Ishura about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Set in a fantasy world, the series follows “Shuras,” a group of demigods who have taken over the world after the death of the Demon King.
