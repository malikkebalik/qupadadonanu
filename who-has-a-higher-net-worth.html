His third album,&nbsp;2001’s&nbsp;8701, produced the number-one singles “U Remind Me” and “U Got It Bad,” eventually selling eight million copies worldwide and winning him his first two Grammy Awards for&nbsp;Best Male R&B Vocal Performance&nbsp;in 2002 and 2003.</p><p id=par-6_71>Usher’s 2004 album Confessions proved that he was an icon in R&B history. The album contained four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: “Yeah!” with&nbsp;Lil Jon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ludacris, “Burn”, “Confessions Part II”, and “My Boo” with&nbsp;<a href=#>Alicia Keys</a>. Confessions was certified Diamond by the RIAA with over 20 million copies sold.&nbsp;He’s continued to release music in the years since then, with a sequel to Confessions titled Confessions 2 slated for release in 2021.</p><p id=par-7_67>Usher has also flexed his acting chops over the years, appearing in notable shows and movies including Moesha, The Faculty, She’s All That and In the Mix. In 2008, he and Scooter Braun co-founded RBMG Records, Justin Bieber’s record label to this day. When he’s not working in the music world, Usher is busy with his co-ownership of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team and streaming service Tidal.</p><p id=par-8_22>Usher’s decades of hard work in entertainment have led to him amassing a sizable personal fortune: $180 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CelebrityNetWorth</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/T-Pain-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-t-pain-s-net-worth-in-2021>T-Pain’s net worth in 2021</h2><p id=par-9_36>T-Pain debuted in the mid-2000s, just as Usher had established himself as a mainstream superstar.
