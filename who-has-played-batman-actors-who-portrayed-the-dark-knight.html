And since then, Batman, formed from the moment when young Bruce Wayne saw his parents robbed and murdered in a dark alley, has become a true symbol of justice. He’s also evolved from the campy persona of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam West</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Classic TV</a> version to the far more realistic — and deadly — <a href=#>takes offered by actors</a> like <a href=#><strong>Michael Keaton</strong></a>, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Bale</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Affleck</a></strong>&nbsp;and now <a href=#><strong>Robert Pattinson</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Kevin Conroy</strong>, who has been voicing the character in animation on and off since 1992, comments in an exclusive interview with Closer, “Different actors bring different things to a role. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Hamill</a>, to me, defined Joker on Batman: The Animated Series. I never thought anyone would ever, ever come close to him, and then I saw <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heath Ledger’s</a> Joker in The Dark Knight and I thought, ‘Wow, that’s a whole other kind of crazy, insane world he’s introducing to Joker.’</p><p>He continued, “I think it was smart of Warner Bros, actually, to have different actors do the live-action Batman, because there have been so many different versions of him. It’s interesting to see, so when I hear other voices doing the character, I don’t get proprietary about it. He’s a wonderful mantle to put on and I wish anyone well who gets to do it. It’s a great character to play.”</p><p>Batman, believes <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong>, who directed the Dark Knight trilogy between 2005 and 2012, has a relevant place in today’s world. “I think he fits in, in a very vital manner because he is a force for good — but only just. What he represents is somebody who is fueled by very negative impulses, but has found a way to channel them into something positive and altruistic,” he revealed. “That is a very relevant form of crime-fighting or justice, if you will, which is very relevant to today’s world.”</p><p>“There are a lot of people dealing with a lot of issues that Bruce Wayne has had to deal with. Certainly, it’s a very relevant issue in our time to look at the rage or anger that might befall someone at a very young age, and what they do with that later in life. That’s an important question to today’s society in all sorts of ways. Do you become a serial killer or a force for good?”</p><p><strong>Check out our guide to the actors who have played Batman over the years, and decide for yourself which side of the line they fall on.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bmK2lkaN6oq%2FTqKmsZWFqhnKFkGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
