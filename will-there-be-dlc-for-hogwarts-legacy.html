Rowling, whose reputation has taken a severe hit because of her transphobic and problematic views over the years, something she is attempting to fix with the podcast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling</a>.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Another reason why Hogwarts Legacy is making headlines currently is because the game’s director Alan Tew has revealed whether there will be downloadable content (DLC) for individuals who do want to enjoy the experience even more. During an appearance at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN Fan Fest</a>, Tew disclosed that due to the team’s preparation for the Hogwarts Legacy launch last week, they have yet to make any plans to release any extra content.</p><p>“We’ve been really heads down bringing [Hogwarts Legacy] to life. So at the moment, there are no current plans for DLC.”</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Despite Tew’s comments, it is unclear if there are any future plans to release additional content. Set in the 1800s, Hogwarts Legacy plot, according&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to the game’s website</a>, is about a character that has a solution “to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart.”</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Since the release of Hogwarts Legacy on Feb. 10,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider</a>&nbsp;reports that it topped the charts as the number one game on the Play Station store and has retained its position as one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most-played titles on Steam</a>, a gaming platform.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=false>As for reviews, fans’ opinions regarding the game have been mixed so far in light of claims of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">game including antisemitic elements</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the ongoing controversy around Rowling</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZorqKknGLBqbHRnmSbnV2ZuaR5xaipZqCfnMSivtOsZKWdl5awuns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
