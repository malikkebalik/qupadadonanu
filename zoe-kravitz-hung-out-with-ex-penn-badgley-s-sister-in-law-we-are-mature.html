In fact, Kravitz hung out with Badgley’s wife’s sister in April 2021.</p><h2 id=h-zoe-kravitz-and-penn-badgley-dated-for-2-years><strong>Zoe</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Kravitz and Penn Badgley dated for 2 years</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoe-kravitz-penn-badgley.jpg><p id=par-2_41>After Badgley’s split from&nbsp;Gossip Girl&nbsp;co-star Blake Lively, he started dating another actor: Kravitz. The pair were first seen together in mid-2011. He told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elle</a>&nbsp;of their often long-distance relationship, “Honesty is always the best policy,” noting, “There are always a lot of arguments.”</p><p id=par-3_48>About a month after that profile was published, Kravitz and Badgely broke up. But they ended things without much of a fuss. “It wasn’t a sad breakup,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;in June 2013. They continue: “It just wasn’t working,” but “it really did end on good terms, though.”</p><h2 id=h-kravitz-got-married-and-divorced><strong>Kravitz got married and divorced</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoe-kravitz-karl-glusman.jpg><p id=par-4_50>A couple of years after her split from Badgley, Kravitz began dating another actor. <a href=#>Karl Glusman</a> is known for films such as&nbsp;Nocturnal Animals&nbsp;and the FX on Hulu miniseries&nbsp;Devs. Mutual friends set them up, and Glusman proposed in February 2018 — a fact Kravitz didn’t reveal to the public for months.</p><p id=par-5_48>Glusman and Kravitz married in June 2019. The Paris ceremony was attended by her&nbsp;<a href=#>Big Little Lies</a>&nbsp;co-stars and, of course, her famous family, including mom Lisa Bonet, dad Lenny Kravitz, and stepfather Jason Momoa. Kravitz filed for divorce in December 2020 after a year and a half of marriage.</p><h2 id=h-badgley-married-domino-kirke><strong>Badgley married Domino Kirke</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/penn-badgley-domino-kirke.jpg><p id=par-6_48>Badgley began dating Domino Kirke in 2014, who, like Kravitz, is the daughter of a musician. In addition to making music herself, Kirke is a doula. In 2017, <a href=#>Badgley and Kirke</a> tied the knot, first in a civil ceremony with their families and then in a larger gathering.</p><p id=par-7_57>“For me, it is a joy to witness you when you are happy,” Badgley wrote on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;for Kirke’s birthday in 2019. “For you, I always hope to be a source of joy. I’m really glad we’re married.” Kirke, who has a child, Cassius Riley, from a previous relationship, gave birth to her first child with Badgley in 2020.</p><h2 id=h-kravitz-hung-out-with-lola-kirke><strong>Kravitz hung out with Lola Kirke</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-8_51>Kirke is not only the daughter of a musician, Simon Kirke, but related to others in show business as well.

She captioned it, “we are mature and enjoy martinis,” though the actors made faces after tasting their drinks.
